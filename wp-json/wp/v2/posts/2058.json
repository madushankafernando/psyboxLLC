The best way to recognize its potential is to analyze blockchain applications examples.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Blockchain Implementation Prospects<\/h2>\n<p>Whatever it is you do, blockchain is able to offer exactly what you need. For software developers, blockchain is the most interesting environment since the advent of the Java language in 1995. For businesspeople, blockchain has become a powerful catalyst for re-engineering business operations and external relations. Blockchain is not just an object, a product, a trend, or an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>The implementation of blockchain has great prospects. The idea behind it is simple but powerful, as it consists primarily of an innovative approach. Due to its modularity, this technology has an infinite variety of uses. This is not just about how to create a better network or bank or provide better service. It\u2019s about utilizing it in our everyday lives.<\/p>\n<p>Distribution of blockchain has expanded gradually, starting with developers and startups. They are followed by companies that have discovered the huge potential of the distributed ledger. Organizations that previously resisted the changes will eventually have to accept and utilize this technology.<\/p>\n<p>To get to this stage, we need more users, more blockchain applications, and more <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/how-to-become-a-blockchain-developer\">developers<\/a>.<\/span> Over the long term, most users will not know or understand that blockchain underlies the software or service they use. Today, we will evaluate the application&#8217;s capabilities in terms of its advantages and convenience, not because it works on the basis of a database or another technology.<\/p>\n<h2>Blockchain Applications Overview<\/h2>\n<p>Blockchain is a software product that allows storage and conversion of data via the Internet, in a secure and transparent way without a central governing body.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a platform that completes transactions without involving a third party;<\/li>\n<li>a system of distributed consensus and trust;<\/li>\n<li>an infrastructure that provides authentication and notarization.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2070\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-node.png\" alt=\"Hyperledger fabric blockchain node\" width=\"1073\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-node.png 1073w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-node-132x61.png 132w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-node-350x162.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-node-500x232.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-node-768x356.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-node-1024x474.png 1024w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-node-600x278.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-node-120x56.png 120w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-node-300x139.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1073px) 100vw, 1073px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Certainly, one of the greatest advantages of blockchain is traceability. The technology was built as an open ledger, filled in chronological order, distributed, verified, and protected against forgery by means of a distributed trust system, thanks to which everything registered there is accessible for tracking, and cannot be deleted. Thus, we can apply this principle of traceability in a variety of areas, for example, products, medicines, works of art, and precious metals.<\/p>\n<p>Below, we will review blockchain applications examples in various spheres. All of these applications have something in common: almost absolute protection of transmission and archiving of information.<\/p>\n<h3>Energy<\/h3>\n<p>Electric power is not the main reason for the hype around the blockchain, but this, of course, is the industry in which the number of blockchain applications is growing steadily.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, with the support of New York leadership, the <em>TransActive Grid<\/em> joint venture decided to combine energy and a decentralized economic system. A micro-network was created consisting of two enterprises: <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/lo3energy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>L03 Energy<\/em><\/a><\/span>, which develops solar energy networks, and <em>ConsenSys<\/em>, which specializes in the blockchain. In this case, the goal is to enable citizens to regain the production of electricity by creating energy mini-communities. For this purpose, sensors record the history of energy creation at a particular point and transmit the data to the airspace blockchain. Smart contracts can then regulate the rules for using this energy as well as the pricing set by producers.<\/p>\n<p><em>The main advantage of this blockchain application is that it will not only reduce dependence on state <\/em>energy<em> but will also encourage users to produce renewable electricity and invest in it independently.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There are some other prospective projects in this sphere. In France, <em>Air Products and Engie<\/em> launched an innovative blockchain technology partnership to certify the traceability of green electricity. <em>Engie<\/em> conducts similar experiments, in particular in the field of tracing flows (water, gas, and electricity), and has done so since 2015.<\/p>\n<p>In July 2016, <em>Ponton<\/em>, a start-up from Germany, developed the <em>Enerchain<\/em> platform, the first European power market based on the blockchain. <em>Enerchain<\/em> allows the anonymous sending of orders. Partners click on a button on the screen to complete a transaction, and everything is done directly, without intermediaries. As of 2018, the company has worked with 39 power and gas traders, developing their peer-to-peer platform.<\/p>\n<p>These initiatives are not just experiments. In fact, the use of micro-energy projects around the world could generate more than $40 billion annually by 2020.<\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2071\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Enerchain-blockchain-middleware.png\" alt=\"Enerchain blockchain middleware\" width=\"617\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Enerchain-blockchain-middleware.png 617w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Enerchain-blockchain-middleware-350x269.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Enerchain-blockchain-middleware-500x385.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Enerchain-blockchain-middleware-600x462.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Enerchain-blockchain-middleware-132x102.png 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>Works of Art<\/h3>\n<p>As for art, the<span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/lu\/en\/pages\/technology\/articles\/blockchain-proof-concept-solve-traceability-issues-art.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em> Deloitte Luxembourg<\/em><\/a><\/span> has developed a technological alternative to traditional paper testimonies confirming the origin of a work of art and its movement.

In the absence of a land cadastre, not only does the state lose income, but landowners cannot confirm that certain territories belong to them. For example, in Africa or Latin America, many countries either do not have a cadastre at all, or their cadastre is unreliable.<\/p>\n<p>To solve this problem, <em>ONG Bitland<\/em> announced the launch of a digital land registry project in Ghana, which will allow owners to survey their land using GPS and record land ownership certificates through the application.

Blockchain prevents fraud and abuse and can solve many other problems, depending upon the <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-implementation\">implementation method<\/a><\/span> and use.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some advantages of blockchain applications:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resistance to failures, since the vulnerable point of failure, is distributed within numerous nodes, making the system more failure-resistant.<\/li>\n<li>Invulnerability to network censorship, since there is no central authority that any party could address and demand the removal of data. Parties cannot even block the domain or IP addresses of the application, because a decentralized application does not need specific addresses or domains. Of course, they can track an individual network user by IP address and disable them. But if the peer-to-peer network is large enough, completely disconnecting the application becomes an impossible task, especially if the nodes are scattered across different countries.<\/li>\n<li>Users are more likely to trust an application that is not controlled by one governing body capable of deceiving them for their own benefit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, every system has both merits and drawbacks. Consider the disadvantages of blockchain applications:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficulties with updating and eliminating errors. The application must be updated on each node of the peer-to-peer network or forked if parts of nodes don\u2019t accept amendments.<\/li>\n<li>Robustness of network for dedicated purposes. Any application has some business logic behind it. In general, this logic defines how new application must work in terms of business requirements. Blockchain, by nature, employs strict logic that doesn\u2019t allow redesign without loss of benefits, which leads to the need for logical business changes to be acceptable to the blockchain solution.<\/li>\n<li>Sometimes, applications need to verify the identity of the user. Since there is no central authority that assures the identity of the user, the development of certain decentralized apps can become a serious problem.<\/li>\n<li>Difficulty of development. It is necessary to apply very complex protocols for achieving consensus and allow for scaling from the very beginning. One cannot hastily implement an idea, hoping sometime later to add new features and expand the application without forking or redeployment of the network.<\/li>\n<li>Normally, applications do not need third-party APIs to store or retrieve data. Your decentralized application (Dapp) should not depend upon the API of centralized applications, but they can depend on other Dapps. In theory, this sounds good, but it may cause difficulties in practice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>A Final Word<\/h3>\n<p>It should be understood that blockchain is a revolutionary technology that will rebuild many present business models, completely transform the economy and society, and make trust a scientific and technological novelty. Nevertheless, the potential for blockchain technology and its full range of use is still in the development stage.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, in reviewing all these projects, we can understand that blockchain technology isn\u2019t going to disappear. It has come to deeply transform our economy and society.\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Blockchain apps are now developed daily and can be considered the most effective tools of the decade.\u00a0Nevertheless, society still does not completely realize the brilliance of this technology, and this lack of understanding stands in the way of its ultimate success.
