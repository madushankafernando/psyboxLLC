Let us shed some light on the subject.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libra poses risks to global banking, and banks will miss out on the game. Banking systems will be deadlocked, with no option left but to shift existing paradigms.\u00a0<\/span><\/span>They will be the same as the internet right now. It\u2019s entirely a commodity at the infrastructure level, but most of the value and money are created in the ecosystem that lives in the top of the infrastructure. The same is going to happen with the upcoming revolution, where large technology companies leading the way.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competitors heard the call to make inroads into global finance. Despite the fact that big technology companies are moving into financial services, they should either support competitive efforts and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launch their own networks or join the Libra Association. With the emergence of more and more networks, the need to search for solutions in the area of inter-blockchain communication (IBC) will increase.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Libra may be a game-changer for improving the worldwide economic situation with inequality.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who is open-minded about Facebook&#8217;s Libra token, existing global payments systems are largely unequal at the moment. He stated that Libra will meet the highest standards of regulation, however.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would happen if money and liquidity became more acceptable in regions without financial inclusion? New investment opportunities will explode in areas where ROI and average infrastructure rate are high.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li>I<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s Libra going to be a Bitcoin rival? Our answer is NO. Let us clarify on that.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google search requests for Bitcoin have risen dramatically in comparison with previous months. What is the reason for the Bitcoin spike?\u00a0 Libra? Perhaps it\u2019s a common phenomenon of renovation intrinsic to the market <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ecosystem.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analysts say that &#8220;Libra is the biggest corporate endorsement of cryptocurrencies yet, and has the potential to introduce billions of potential users to the idea of value transfer via blockchain. This should benefit Bitcoin, as well.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key difference between Libra and Bitcoin is that Bitcoin has been compared to gold, therefore, regarded as more of an investment and store-of-value. \u201cYou don\u2019t pay with gold, but you still hold it as a part of your investment portfolio\u201d, proponents of Bitcoin gold analogy explain.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is not owned or governed by any central party. It\u2019s trustless, whereas Libra users will have to trust the company. Nowadays, gold and currency are different concepts with different roles. No one wants to buy coffee for gold. While Libra will be a currency for day-to-day transactions and payments, Bitcoin will become entrenched as a \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We assume that Libra is a positive tailwind, and its popularization will only add to awareness around Bitcoin.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s in It for You?<\/span><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Tokenized reward systems<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Being resistant to inflation, tokenized loyalty programs go way beyond traditional centralized reward systems taking businesses to the next level of interaction with customers. The tokenized solution provides higher flexibility and greater access to customers within the business ecosystem. Due to classic loyalty programs lacking liquidity, loyalty programs make manageable systems inefficient.<\/span><\/span>Tokenized rewards can serve as a stable and permanent loyalty model since tokens are based on blockchain, being immutable and ensuring more trust between users. With tokens\u2019 flexibility and high liquidity, customers will get more value and easier potential use.<\/li>\n<li><b>Libra competitor?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Thinking of all the competitors who would like to retain their competitive edge &#8211; wouldn\u2019t they want to have their own solution competing with Libra?
