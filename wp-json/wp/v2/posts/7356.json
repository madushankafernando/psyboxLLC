Let&#8217;s figure out what it is and how it works?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Tokenization?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of today, the main instrument for representing physical assets is securities, such as stocks, bonds, checks, etc. With the proliferation of blockchain technology, a powerful new tool has emerged to convert the rights of a physical asset into a digital token. The name of this process is tokenization. Tokenization allows you to convert the rights of a physical asset into a digital token. The main advantages of this method over traditional trading in securities are trading speed, transparency, and security.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last two points are provided by using the blockchain:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7362 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tokenization-platform-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"274\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tokenization-platform-1.jpeg 480w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tokenization-platform-1-350x200.jpeg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tokenization-platform-1-132x75.jpeg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the tokenization process, the resulting tokens can be traded in the secondary market, which facilitates the trading of physical assets, allows the cost of indivisible assets to be shared, and ensures the safety and transparency of all related processes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, tokenization allows for increased liquidity of assets by reducing the threshold for entering the market and the minimum transaction amount. An important feature of tokenization is the ability to share the value of indivisible assets (such as real estate, art, etc.), which will attract investors with little capital and will make it easier to benefit from initially expensive and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/i\/illiquid.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">illiquid assets<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purpose of Tokenization<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is tokenization becoming such a popular topic? Because it implies the creation of a holistic infrastructure, with the ability to audit, exchange, and connect third parties. All these operations will be much cheaper than using traditional infrastructures. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tokenization companies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/money.usnews.com\/investing\/cryptocurrency\/slideshows\/11-ways-blockchain-is-revolutionizing-investing?slide=2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investing has become cheaper<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, faster, safer, and more accessible. All of this creates opportunities for users who previously encountered financial or geographic constraints to invest in assets. They will have an alternative to traditional and, by and large, outdated investment methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7361 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tokenization-Platform-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tokenization-Platform-2.jpg 512w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tokenization-Platform-2-500x223.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tokenization-Platform-2-350x156.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tokenization-Platform-2-132x59.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since tokenization takes place using the blockchain, companies can introduce a new asset management system that can increase liquidity, provide the ability to manage assets to all participants, and even apply sharing scenarios. It can also more efficiently integrate such components of the traditional securities market as a depository, a stock exchange, a clearinghouse, and software.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenization began to be used in various industries as a method of making payments that does not require the transfer of any confidential information and personal data. This is accomplished by sending data as a sequence of characters that lose value outside of a strictly defined context. Thus, it endows such tokens with security and safety characteristics. The arrival in 2015 of a new digital asset &#8211; Ether &#8211; opened up new horizons for tokens, expanding the range of their use.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Can You Tokenize?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can tokenize any class of assets, both illiquid and liquid &#8211; stocks, debt instruments, metals, intellectual property, real estate, etc. Tokenization can be applied by businesses to simplify accounting and settlements, as well as by government institutions to automate processes. There is the opinion that if everything is tokenized, the world will turn into one huge stock exchange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-startups\/blockchain-and-real-estate\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real estate tokenization<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the most exciting area of \u200b\u200bblockchain projects. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real estate tokenization companies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will translate the economic value of the real estate market into a more liquid form.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: The real estate market remains the most attractive target for investors.

But there are also more complex variants of tokens, the value of which is determined at the level of the accounting system itself. For example, tokens are calculated and awarded for certain user actions within the platform itself. Then the provision of tokens is guaranteed by a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/developers\/docs\/consensus-mechanisms\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consensus mechanism<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by which the state of the database (blockchain) is validated.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenization Platform<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Advantages\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main advantage of tokenization is that tokens can be fully used within the environment of their use, but are completely useless outside of it. Tokenization is ideal for protecting sensitive data such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and any other data that attackers regularly steal for use or sale on the black market. If attackers fail to hack into the tokenization server itself in order to obtain real data associated with tokens, then the stolen tokens will not give them any opportunity to use them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Tokenization platform<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provides the following benefits:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compliance with legal regulations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programmable securities<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elevated liquidity<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24\/7 market availability<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fractionalization of property<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No intermediaries<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost-efficiency\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transparency<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenization companies <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> create a uniquely identifiable token that is associated with a given asset &#8211; the Ethereum ERC721 token.
