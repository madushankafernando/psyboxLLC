These blockchains are known as parachains and parathreads connect via Polkadot relay chains and share security. They connect with external networks using specialized bridges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using a common relay chain to hook all participating blockchain, there is a formation of a consensus mechanism that guides the whole network. This consensus serves as the basis of shared security present within the network. We will examine the benefits and the issues that may arise due to this single-point security system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">applicature<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">parachain on Polkadot development company<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with expert <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polkadot security auditors<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who will help you determine the integrity and security of your network. Also, we have made excellent contributions to blockchain development and our experience makes us up to the task when it comes to fixing loopholes within Polkadot or blockchain networks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Security of the network<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Polkadot network works using a shared security framework. Sometimes referred to as pooled security in written documentation, this has become the selling point for many blockchain platforms willing to become a parachain on the Polkadot network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7342 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Applicature-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Applicature-2.jpg 512w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Applicature-2-500x261.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Applicature-2-350x183.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Applicature-2-132x69.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Parachain Versus Bridges<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By design, a parachain slot is leased to each parachain connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain and this will enable them to benefit from the business security presented by the Relay Chain validators. On the other hand, if the interchain link is built on a protocol that uses bridges, each chain is regarded as independent and must have its economic security and validators.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Polkadot consensus<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Polkadot, the disparity between chain security will be absent. Whenever there is a connection between a parachain to the Polkadot network, security is provided by the Relay Chain validator set during the parachain&#8217;s transitions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The beauty of this system is that the parachain will only need to run a few collator nodes to update the validators about the latest state transitions and proofs\/witnesses. The Validators will only have to check for the parachains assigned to them. This process makes it possible for newly launched parachains to immediately benefit from the existing overall security of Polkadot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses of Polkadot<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One major concern in the Polkadot protocols is the subject of scalability of the security framework. There is a tendency for lower market cap alternative coins to be filtered down while the bigger market cap altcoins fill their blocks making the lower market cap altcoins have a lesser layer of security that are easier or prone to a cyber-attack.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A classic example is an attack on Ethereum on January 10, 2019. An Anonymous attacker double-spent a total of 219,500 ETC (approximately 1.1M USD). This is where you can rely on our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polkadot security auditors<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at Applicature to audit your network for security bridges and have our experts fix possible glitches in your network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polkadot on its part overcomes security scalability by directing all economic incentives to the Relay Chain, allowing the parachains to tap into stronger fidelity at genesis. However, Independent chains must make an effort to increase the value of their coin to make it difficult or impossible to be attacked by well-funded attackers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Doing a proper Polkadot Security Audit<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7341 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Applicature-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"335\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Applicature-3.jpeg 512w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Applicature-3-500x327.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Applicature-3-350x229.jpeg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Applicature-3-132x86.jpeg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polkadot is created in a complex and reliable way to attain sound security of the network. However, some gaps need to be closed, and doing a security audit is important. It is vital to ensure the correctness of the parachain\u2019s code, especially concerning critical requirements, such as ensuring the immutability of the state of the parachain after the link is established.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fishermen on the network are only rewarded when they detect fraud.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure compliance there is a need to make sure that:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1) Fishermen need to get a reward for checking validators independently and reporting early.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) Fishermen and other validators need a longer finality period to find and report jeopardized blocks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3) Only a final block should permit transactions since independent blockchains cannot be reverted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polkadot is not only scaling up the existing blockchains through parachains and bridges, they are undertaking the huge challenge of implementing shared security to multiple blockchains. They are solving this problem through a mechanism that allows collaboration leading to the prevention of possible attack vectors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there may be weaknesses within the Polkadot framework, fishermen are always fishing for attacks and they help to prevent collusion of parachain validators. Hence, it will be a good idea to have permanent fishermen who will receive rewards for their role.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our team at Applicature, a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">parachain on Polkadot development company<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are always ready and willing to help you with your Polkadot needs.
