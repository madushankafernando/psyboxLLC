The purpose of Polkadot is to allow blockchain networks to enhance scalability, optimize themselves for specific use cases, work and collaborate, self-govern, and upgrade without the need for complex processes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staking and lending<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staking and lending of decentralized platforms are easier and faster to access unlike what obtains in traditional banks. Polkadot is a key supporter of staking on their platform. Polkadot has gained attention for staking, with more than $2.5 billion worth of DOT tokens at stake. Polkadot is the largest network by staking value, DOT has generated a positive return in the U.S. dollar, bitcoin, and ether over the first 90 days of trading of the token when it was launched by the network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7250 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Group-1-500x267.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Group-1-500x267.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Group-1-350x187.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Group-1-768x411.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Group-1-600x321.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Group-1-132x71.png 132w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Group-1.png 898w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to lending, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-technology\/the-fundamentals-of-defi\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeFi<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> protocols permit users to lend or borrow in a completely decentralized way.

Polkadot is an interoperable ecosystem on its own. Our experts are already using Substrate, composed of various components to build useful tools on this platform. Just like what Applicature did with DeFi with a backdrop of blockchain integration services and tools we can build a DeFi Network on Polkadot using the Relay Chain, parachains, parathreads, and bridges. Together, using these elements we form a developer\u2019s framework to create interoperable decentralized applications (dApps) harnessing the liquidity of Ethereum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s take a look at some typical DeFi protocols that have contributed to the increased value in Polkadot\u2019s blocks. Polkadot\u2019s technology positions them as important components of the ecosystem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Polkaswap<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polkaswap is a DeFi Exchange created uniquely for the Polkadot framework using the SORA v2 network. It gives security,\u00a0 liquidity, convenience, and a user-friendly UX, where an instant exchange of blockchain assets can take place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is similar to the Uniswap on Polkadot, a DEX that allows users to set up multiple liquidity sources. Also, it makes cross-chain swap possible, which is ideal for the Polkadot ecosystem offering transfer charges that are lower than Ethereum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users can yield farm PSWAP, Polkaswap&#8217;s token and it allows users to create liquidity on token trading pairs in the Polkaswap DEX platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>ChainX<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This community-driven project is built on the next-generation blockchain framework substrate, it has a token called PCX, and it is the largest Layer-2 network of Bitcoin backed by smart contracts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It removes the barriers between blockchain assets and creates a public chain ecosystem for integrating multiple currencies. It makes it possible to transfer ETH, BTC, EOS, or DOT across various blockchains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The market value of BTC, DOT, ETH, ERC20, EOS, and other assets depends on their users\u2019 mining power, the amount deposited by an inter-chain bridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Akropolis<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Akropolis is aiming to build economies that are decentralized and autonomous in its community. It has a token AKRO and gives the basic tools for DAO creation, staking, borrowing, and lending.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has successfully integrated with some of the best DeFi projects on Ethereum like Compound, dYdX, MakerDAO, Fulcrum, Aave, and Curve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has plans to integrate a fiat gateway, where users can effortlessly fund their wallets using a credit card. In the future, it will support many stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and TUSD.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MANTRA DAO<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MANTRA DAO is also a community-governed DeFi platform with an OM token that allows holders to engage in key decisions and get rewarded for their contributions. This platform focuses on staking, lending, and governance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MANTRA DAO effortlessly supports non-custodial staking using the Polkadot ecosystem assets. It allows users to access $DOT &amp; $KSM staking through MANTRA DAO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>ChainLink<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ChainLink with its &#8220;LINK&#8221; token is a leading decentralized data oracles network. This platform provides the needed connection between smart contracts and the inputs and outputs necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an important addition to the DeFi sector because its data oracles are integrated with almost all Ethereum-based DeFi projects. This link accounts for its profit during the recent DeFi boom with its token LINK\u2019s market cap surpassing $3B, ranking highly among other similar tokens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chainlink was integrated with Polkadot in February 2020 and became the primary provider of decentralized data oracles facility to parachains on the Polkadot network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeFi projects in Polkadot are not just about repeating existing concepts but generating new ideas altogether. We&#8217;re heading into interesting times as more and more teams are building DeFi on Polkadot, they are combining creativity with highly scalable and composable systems. We look forward to a promising future as talented teams expand the use cases for what\u2019s obtainable today and create new, novel products for the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need an expert <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parachain on Polkadot development company<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, get in touch with us.
