What\u2019s New on Your Side?<\/h2>\n<p>Trustless anarchy in the crypto industry, especially with the appearance of IEO (initial exchange offerings), has incited players in this ecosystem come up with an advanced alternative solution to setting up a new algorithm for fundraising operations. An initial exchange offering is an innovative approach to the crowdsale process: a revolutionized fundraising model that enables crypto projects to raise funds directly on exchanges.<\/p>\n<p>This token sale concept is somewhat similar to an initial coin offering (ICO). An IEO provides investors and stakeholders with the opportunity to enter the cryptocurrency ecosystem through an exchange in order to contribute funds to a particular project. The major difference in the IEO process is that it operates via cryptocurrency exchange instead of token-sale cabinets or project websites. This approach allows known, proven exchanges to administer the process of investment contribution and grant stakeholders a higher level of security.<\/p>\n<p>With an IEO, projects and startups can approach crypto exchanges to provide information about their product, idea, token model, and necessity. Afterward, crypto exchanges perform a due-diligence check and precisely research the project\u2019s documentation to ensure its feasibility and credibility. This process grants participation only to promising projects with a well-stated, well-thought-out development strategy.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-2.png\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4181\" alt=\"initial-exchange-offering-pros-and-cons\" width=\"985\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-2.png 985w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-2-106x110.png 106w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-2-337x350.png 337w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-2-481x500.png 481w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-2-768x798.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-2-600x624.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-2-115x120.png 115w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-2-289x300.png 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 985px) 100vw, 985px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Is an IEO a Justifiable Substitution for an ICO?<\/h3>\n<p>Unlike ICOs, initial exchange offerings are backed by an exchange platform.

Let\u2019s see the advantages initial exchange offerings offer to each party in the crypto system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Projects and Startups<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The benefit for projects is simple: commonly, project developers aren\u2019t cryptocurrency experts or token-launch specialists. The process of a token sale event launch requires proficient experience and knowledge. In the case of an IEO, projects can rely on the exchange\u2019s expertise to conduct the token sale for them. There is no need to establish and develop costly TGE cabinets or integrate KYC\/AML modules, as the exchange takes care of these processes and grants reliability and security. In addition, cryptocurrency exchanges promote tokens and conduct <\/span>marketing<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> <\/span>activities<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to let a high number of users know about the project and its goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Investors and Stakeholders<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Token sales are usually established on a known exchange with global presence and a big number of users who trust its services. Investors and those willing to contribute are assured of a trustless deal settlement and easy contribution process. As long as the token is listed on the exchange, investors can feel safe that the project has undergone due-diligence research. With proven viability, there is no need to conduct separate research on the project and its team. Another advantage is the ease of contribution of funds, which doesn\u2019t require complex transaction processing with several wallets. Instead, the investor only needs to deposit funds in the exchange account, and the tokens can be purchased. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Exchanges<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cryptocurrency platforms and exchanges benefit from IEO process settlement, as they charge fees for the token to be listed. Fees range from very low up to 40 BTC. This depends on the exchange, its services, and its market reputation. Though IEOs might be costly in certain cases, a token event can raise millions of dollars for project development, fully covering listing expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">IEO Process Review: How to Become a Member<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Generally, there are no strict rules regarding the IEO launch process. Timelines, duration, and fees vary from exchange to exchange, and are negotiable. Rules and requirements depend upon the exchange, as well. However, there are common guidelines and \u201cmust-haves\u201d projects will need to follow in order to ready themselves for an IEO launch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before considering the full process of listing an IEO on an exchange, let\u2019s split it into two stages:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Preparation stage<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Establishment of Cooperation with an Exchange <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are critical factors for a project to consider before partnering with exchanges in order to conduct an IEO. This is actually the strong point of initial exchange offering policies: professional due diligence is a compulsory procedure for any project. You will want to be fully prepared before stepping onto the IEO path, since without a well-organized strategy and solid background, your efforts could turn out to be useless. This is the reason for the rigid approach of exchanges toward project reviews. If misleading activities are revealed, they risk their reputation; and correspondingly, the project is doomed to failure without a second chance to take part in the IEO. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We have negotiated with plenty of exchanges, thoroughly studied the mechanism of IEO listings, and analyzed the major metrics of project credibility. So here it is. We\u2019ve compiled a definitive list for your project to succeed.

There are a vast spectrum of legal requirements and recommendations for accessing an IEO, including: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">preparation of operating &amp; investment documentation<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KYC procedures <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">risk assessments to get rid of pitfalls during the IEO process<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SEC compliance &nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To protect projects and their investors, it is critical to mitigate risk through regulatory compliance. Legal experts provide vital know-how to properly structure and form the financial and legal foundation of your offering. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Smart-Contract Development &amp; Audit<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your smart contract needs to be 100% secure since any minor vulnerability could cause destructive ramifications and lose billions of funds. It\u2019s critical <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">hire a smart contract <\/span>audit<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> company <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-technology\/smart-contract-audits-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to review and audit your smart-contract architecture<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and codebase <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-technology\/history-of-ethereum-security-vulnerabilities-hacks-and-their-fixes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to identify vulnerable spots<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> beforehand. Our technical team analyzes smart-contract design to understand business logic first.

A <\/span>qualified<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> blockchain marketing agency will help you find an appropriate audience and create hype around your product by driving attention to it and attracting investments. In terms of the IEO, exchanges are interested in taking care of the marketing campaign, as the startup pays fees, and a certain percentage of the tokens sold goes to the exchange account. Therefore, startups can now save on marketing their budget in comparison to the considerable financial expenditures inherent to ICOs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One more interesting thing is the current favorable audience climate, which creates a better contribution rate for the project thanks to the existing customer base on the exchange. Nevertheless, the other 50% of your success depends on your own marketing strategy and design.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MVP\/Product Prototype<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Compared to ICOs, in which well-designed project concepts (mostly described in white papers) illuminate the main incentives and points of trust for investors, an IEO is an absolutely different model, right down to the details of product development progress described throughout the project roadmap. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Due to the high percentage of scam ICOs, people can no longer believe bare ideas. Even with project development underway (for example, the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><i>Fetch.AI<\/i><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> project, which has developed an internally operational test network operating since September 2018), this factor is favorable when approaching an exchange. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An accurate example of a minimal viable product is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><i>BitTorrent<\/i><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, with 100 million users before their IEO launch.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Step-by-Step Interaction with Exchanges <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once the preparation stage has been finalized, with consideration of all of the above-mentioned factors, it\u2019s time to step into direct interaction with exchanges:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Team founders get in touch with listing support managers to discuss further actions on the exchange. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A team member submits a request with detailed information about the project (smart-contract address, white paper, team members, MVP, business plan, all relevant documentation, data about token distribution, related links to software resources, etc.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before running an IEO, founders need to agree on listing fees.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Direct communication with project founders and their partners to confirm the credibility of the team and the project itself. Factors like MVP, product prototypes, previous success in product development, public announcements, and technical and business maturity are key when negotiating with exchanges. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Signing an engagement letter and agreement on a listing fee.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to legal documents approved by a legal blockchain advisor, exchanges define restrictions on investment policy. Anyone has the right to invest in an IEO, except restricted countries with regard to digital assets: the U.S., North Korea, China, New Zealand, and Venezuela. Each investor has to go through the KYC procedure in order to be verified on the platform.&nbsp;<\/span>It is worth mentioning the partnership between the crypto exchange <i>Binance<\/i> and <a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-experts-interviews\/kyc-solutions-interview-identitymind-global-product-management-leader-faisal-nasar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the risk-management firm <\/a><i>IdentityMind<\/i> to enhance KYC\/AML compliance measures with IdentityMind tools.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Smart <\/span>contract<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> development company generates tokens with the ERC20 standard or any other ERC-compatible standards supported by a specific exchange, then send them to the exchange account in accordance with the mutual agreement.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These tokens are visible to users on the platform to conduct transactions. After the funds are transferred, the platform makes public announcements on its media channels.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The exchange establishes a maximum investment limit and restrictions on contributors.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sale procedure can last for several minutes\/hours for large exchanges. For small ones, it can last a few days. &nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Are You Ready to IEO? Take Care of Your Project\u2019s Due Diligence in Advance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Currently, crypto exchanges offer a favorable microclimate for a coin launch <\/span>platform<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. However, that doesn\u2019t mean startups can neglect scrupulous consideration of criteria in order to become endorsed by the exchange. They must follow all the requirements in order to penetrate this new crypto niche and, <\/span>preferably<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, hire a <\/span>blockchain<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> adviser and smart contract audit company. With all \u201cweapons\u201d in your arsenal ready to go (see our must-haves, listed above), and after undergoing due-diligence review and auditing, you can be 100% assured that you are ready to conquer the IEO path. The exchange, as an intermediary platform, is responsible for ensuring project credibility for stakeholders. <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cIEO is a very time-sensitive and emerging crypto-market niche to penetrate.
