It is becoming apparent that blockchain implementation is an enhanced means for developing corporate services, business promotion, and success.<\/p>\n<p>The history of blockchain goes back to 2008, when it was conceptualized and presented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Formerly, blockchain technology had been proposed as a core component and working principle for Bitcoin. With the rapid development of technology today, we are witnessing the benefits of blockchain technology and smart-contract implementation.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Blockchain Technology?<\/h2>\n<p>To put it simply, blockchain is a new and decentralized way to offer a digital, distributed database independent of central authority. It is also referred to as a distributed ledger, which stores and records all types of data in numerous blocks connected in one block structure.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain characteristics include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transparency (all users can access the necessary data)<\/li>\n<li>immutability\/irreversibility (records cannot be changed)<\/li>\n<li>high security (all personal data is highly protected)<\/li>\n<li>cost efficiency<\/li>\n<li>decentralization<\/li>\n<li>ease of use (finds its use in various industries)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1832\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/how-can-blockchain-amplify-digital-identifiers-improving-data-persistence-openness-and-trust-in-the-modern-world-6-638.jpg\" alt=\"Blockchain features\" width=\"638\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/how-can-blockchain-amplify-digital-identifiers-improving-data-persistence-openness-and-trust-in-the-modern-world-6-638.jpg 638w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/how-can-blockchain-amplify-digital-identifiers-improving-data-persistence-openness-and-trust-in-the-modern-world-6-638-350x263.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/how-can-blockchain-amplify-digital-identifiers-improving-data-persistence-openness-and-trust-in-the-modern-world-6-638-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/how-can-blockchain-amplify-digital-identifiers-improving-data-persistence-openness-and-trust-in-the-modern-world-6-638-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/how-can-blockchain-amplify-digital-identifiers-improving-data-persistence-openness-and-trust-in-the-modern-world-6-638-132x99.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Blockchain technology is widely used nowadays, as it solves a range of issues in the organizational processes of all industries. Once data is entered into a block, it is almost impossible to change, as such actions require the approval of all members involved in the system. Its decentralized nature attracts users, as there are no governmental control or restrictions. Still, all participants can be sure of security and the protection of their personal rights. Blockchain unites entrepreneurs, companies, entities, and other participants by allowing them to share data quickly, securely, and from any part of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Smart contracts are another significant part of the blockchain world. A smart contract is a tool for ensuring blockchain working principles. It is a cryptographically-encrypted set of codes running on blockchain that controls cryptocurrency transfers between parties and ensures that all conditions are met. A single user can create a code, which is automatically executed on any blockchain platform (Ethereum, NXT, Bitcoin, Chain, etc.). Such execution is possible only when two parties comply with the requirements; thus, third-party involvement is not needed. Smart contracts guarantee speed, safety (as all rights and funds are protected), and a high level of reliability (as cheating is impossible).<\/p>\n<h2>Blockchain Implementation in Various Industries<\/h2>\n<p>One of the pros of blockchain implementation is that it can be applied to any type of data. There are numerous ways to deploy smart contracts to satisfy any type of need.<br \/>\nFor this reason, many industries are applying blockchain technology to enhance the quality of their business offerings, whether they deal with a product or service, or provide some kind of support.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1833\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Blockchain-use-cases-3-1430x715.jpg\" alt=\"Blockchain industry use cases\" width=\"1430\" height=\"715\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Blockchain-use-cases-3-1430x715.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Blockchain-use-cases-3-1430x715-350x175.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Blockchain-use-cases-3-1430x715-500x250.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Blockchain-use-cases-3-1430x715-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Blockchain-use-cases-3-1430x715-600x300.jpg 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Blockchain-use-cases-3-1430x715-132x66.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1430px) 100vw, 1430px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The first field to apply blockchain technology was <strong>cryptocurrency<\/strong>. As the trend of investing in crypto became popular, it required a decentralized way of conducting transactions between parties as well as an opportunity to exchange or trade these cryptocurrencies. Thus, when investors started purchasing coins and tokens, they used various blockchain platforms to enable fast, secure transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the emergence of ICO projects and their launches, investment in coins became less popular. The reason for this is that ICOs also provide an opportunity for token purchase at a gradually increasing value. In addition, they tend to offer some kind of product or service that is valuable, useful, and provides solutions to relevant issues in the community.<\/p>\n<p>As of today, blockchain can be applied in the following industries:<\/p>\n<h3>Automotive, commercial vehicle transportation, public transportation, and ride-sharing:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>to track real vehicle history from production to sale<\/li>\n<li>to track journey details, information, stops, etc.<\/li>\n<li>to provide more accurate payment options<\/li>\n<li>to streamline transportation development services<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Banking, FinTech, credit history:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>develop more efficient payment systems<\/li>\n<li>process faster and more secure monetary transactions<\/li>\n<li>enhance international payment procedures<\/li>\n<li>minimize audit complexity<\/li>\n<li>keep track of credit history accurately<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Charity and donations:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>track donation allocation, accountability, and integrity<\/li>\n<li>simplify the donation payment processes<\/li>\n<li>provide an audit donation trail to prevent scams<\/li>\n<li>keep accessible information on participants and ensure that organizations receive their funds<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Education:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>digitize and verify academic credentials<\/li>\n<li>simplify communication between students\/parents\/teachers\/institutions<\/li>\n<li>provide a common accessible database for sharing knowledge, documents, and information<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Energy:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>provide cheaper P2P transfers and trades<\/li>\n<li>organize smart utility metering<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Legal, government, and insurance:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>reduce scams in voting procedures<\/li>\n<li>avoid fraudulent activities in governmental organizations<\/li>\n<li>provide identity validation<\/li>\n<li>provide integrity of public registry data<\/li>\n<li>improve and streamline the efficiency of insurance contracts<\/li>\n<li>reduce issues with data transparency<\/li>\n<li>provide public and legal data accessibility for relevant parties<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>IoT and AI:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>enable IoT applications to contribute transactional data to the blockchain<\/li>\n<li>simplify trucking, transportation, and supply-chain processes<\/li>\n<li>allow enhanced use of artificial intelligence machines in various spheres<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Marketing and media:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>avoid intermediaries while promoting advertising and commercial campaigns<\/li>\n<li>increase cost efficiency<\/li>\n<li>control the rights of ownership<\/li>\n<li>enhance copyright protection<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Healthcare and medicine:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>improve drug supply-chain efficiency and integrity<\/li>\n<li>provide accessible patient\/doctor\/insurance database<\/li>\n<li>manage fast, transparent patient-to-doctor transactions<\/li>\n<li>provide safety and security for patients\u2019 personal data<\/li>\n<li>allow information-sharing between medical institutions\/doctors\/professors worldwide<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This high number of beneficial features proves how much blockchain technology can contribute to any sphere with regard to efficient workflow and productivity.

Before beginning, a company should thoroughly think through its business strategy to make sure blockchain is a match and the right solution. As long as a company has to deal with data storage, transaction processing, and the provision of transparent, shared information for users, it should consider the step of BC technology implementation.<\/p>\n<p>According to Jeff Garzik, Bloq co-founder, there exist four main stages of blockchain implementation.<\/p>\n<h3>Stage 1<\/h3>\n<p><em>Identify the use case, and scope out a technological development plan.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1834\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Jeff-Garzik-quote.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Garzik's quote\" width=\"745\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Jeff-Garzik-quote.jpg 745w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Jeff-Garzik-quote-350x91.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Jeff-Garzik-quote-500x130.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Jeff-Garzik-quote-600x155.jpg 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Jeff-Garzik-quote-132x34.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Therefore, in the first stage, it\u2019s important to ensure that the company\u2019s service or product really needs blockchain implementation, with the help of which customers will gain value as a final outcome. Additionally, the company must have reasonable issues or problems that blockchain technology will solve. Only in this case will implementation be successful.<\/p>\n<h3>Stage 2<\/h3>\n<p><em>Proof of Concept (PoC).<\/em> A PoC plan addresses how the company\u2019s product or service supports development goals. This plan should include precise success criteria, documentation stating how the PoC is going to be carried out, an evaluation aspect, and outlined suggestions for provided solutions. The PoC plan is an integral aspect that determines product\/service delivery to the global market.<\/p>\n<h3>Stage 3<\/h3>\n<p><em>Organize a field trial, and run limited tryouts with customer feedback.<\/em> The next step of BC implementation is running tryouts. This phase is crucial, as well, because it determines whether the strategy has been technically well-developed. In case of problems, the company must take improvement measures, eliminating potential risks and mistakes to ensure product\/service quality. Customer feedback is much valued, as the client\u2019s opinion is important and their suggestions should be taken into consideration.<\/p>\n<h3>Stage 4<\/h3>\n<p><em>Roll out the product for community use.<\/em> This is the final stage. As soon as all strategic moves have been evaluated and all risks eliminated, the company is ready to roll out the final version of the product or service.<\/p>\n<p>There are several ways to technically implement blockchain technology. Let\u2019s consider some of them:<\/p>\n<h2>Blockchain Implementation: Java Code<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s find out more about blockchain architecture, in particular working-principle examples with codes. <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/dzone.com\/articles\/blockchain-implementation-with-java-code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DZone<\/a><\/span> provides examples of blockchain implementation Java code use:<\/p>\n<h3>Immutability<\/h3>\n<p>How is it provided?<\/p>\n<p>The SHA-256 hash, computed for transaction processes, proves BC immutability; the content of a certain block is hashed, providing unique identifiers. These hashes are stored from previous blocks and hashed into the next block header, making it impossible to tamper with. Below is a Java example of the properties of a block:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1835\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Java-block-properties.jpg\" alt=\"Properties of a block in Java\" width=\"798\" height=\"244\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Java-block-properties.jpg 798w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Java-block-properties-350x107.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Java-block-properties-500x153.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Java-block-properties-768x235.jpg 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Java-block-properties-600x183.jpg 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Java-block-properties-132x40.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Block Hash<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, a block hash can be computed by each block, within which transactions can be serialized to JSON.<\/p>\n<h3>Chain<\/h3>\n<p>Blocks are managed by accepting transactions; thus, a block can be created when a preset threshold has been reached.

They can either represent the execution code (smart contract) or store certain transaction information. These transactions are processed outside blocks or chains; they get into the network, and are combined together. At this stage, consensus algorithms should be used, usually to avoid the risk of double-spending.<\/p>\n<h3>Creating a Merkle Tree<\/h3>\n<p>After adding transactions to a block, it is important to create a Merkle Tree data structure for storing the Merkle Tree root, which validates transactions:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1838\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Merkle-Tree-Java.jpg\" alt=\"Merkle Tree structure\" width=\"633\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Merkle-Tree-Java.jpg 633w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Merkle-Tree-Java-132x64.jpg 132w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Merkle-Tree-Java-350x169.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Merkle-Tree-Java-500x242.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Merkle-Tree-Java-600x290.jpg 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Merkle-Tree-Java-120x58.jpg 120w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Merkle-Tree-Java-300x145.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Testing<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, everything has to go through final JUnit tests.<\/p>\n<h2>Blockchain Implementation: Python<\/h2>\n<p>Python is another blockchain implementation programming language.

This question is complex, as it depends upon what, exactly, the company wants to do \u2014 and where, exactly, blockchain technology needs to be applied. Generally, blockchain setup is free of cost, and there are numerous open-source blockchain platforms that can be used. If someone wants to use blockchain for data storage, he or she can fork the blockchain platform online. This is easy, especially if you are a developer.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the type of project in which blockchain should be implemented, there are additional services that should be considered, and this can cost a certain amount of money. Let\u2019s research some approximate prices for such services.<\/p>\n<p>The estimated cost is dependent upon the type of project. As blockchain technology requires smart-contract development and execution, a company must consult and cooperate with <strong>smart-contract development<\/strong> agencies. The cost of SC execution varies from approximately $3,000 to $10,000. SC is a significant part of blockchain technology, and should be paid a great deal of attention. As SCs are immutable and can only be deployed once, the code has to be well-written and hack-resistant without any vulnerable spots. Therefore, the price is reasonable.<\/p>\n<p>If the company needs <strong>decentralized applications development (DApps)<\/strong>, it should consider that the price of one starts at approximately $1000.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Launching an ICO<\/strong> project is a whole other story, as this process requires not only BC implementation, but also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>white-paper writing, taking into consideration legal compliance, token economics, design, and<\/li>\n<li>business plan <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\">($1,500-$50,000)<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>website\/landing page development <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\">($500-$35,000)<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>token economics, ERC20 token customization, enhancing payment processes, funds distribution, and bounty consulting <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\">($10,000-$50,000)<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>legal fees <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\">($50,000-$150,000)<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>smart-contract development <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\">($3,000-$30,000)<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>marketing services, PR campaign, SMM management (there is a golden rule: $1 invested in marketing will bring $10 in contributions)<\/li>\n<li>KYC or AML implementation (prices vary from agency to agency)<\/li>\n<li>providing security <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\">(up to $10,000)<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It can be seen that an ICO launch requires many skills and the effort of a range of professionals plus a whole team of developers, consultants, and workers in various spheres.
