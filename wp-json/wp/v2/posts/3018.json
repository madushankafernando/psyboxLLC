Currently, up to 10,000 people could become blockchain developers with various levels of proficiency. However, this number could rise to 100,000 within two years if companies experience increased demand and begin to require more blockchain developers. Automatically, more people will start to learn about blockchain. This is also true for non-technical people who come straight from business, who want to understand the standards of blockchain and inject them into their business models in a lean and efficient manner.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, everyone will want to work with professionals. The blockchain sphere is obviously one that is oriented to quality, not quantity.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain is considered a prominent application for use in many fields, including banking, retail, and education. While the number of use cases of blockchain continues to grow, blockchain technology is still difficult to learn and understand, so the need for education arises.<\/p>\n<h2>Is Blockchain Education Important?<\/h2>\n<p>The data of one of the most popular freelancing websites, Upwork, shows that today, blockchain is the technology in the highest demand. The cooldown of the cryptocurrency market hasn\u2019t influenced the increase in demand for blockchain job skills, which grew 6,000% in just the first quarter of this year.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain development for businesses was ranked first among the top 20 fastest-growing job skills.<\/p>\n<p>In Silicon Valley, New York City, or Boston, where blockchain is the most popular, the annual salary of a blockchain developer is $158,000.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to their salary, many blockchain developers receive a premium of $18,000.<\/p>\n<p>Jerry Cuomo is the best blockchain engineer, and he earns a salary above $250,000.<\/p>\n<p>Experts say the demand for blockchain expertise is coming from all fields, and this is just the beginning of the blockchain era.<\/p>\n<p>Another factor that proves that blockchain education is a must-have today is personal security. Millions of passwords are stolen on an annual basis. You may ask why this happens, but if you look at the most popular passwords, you will probably conclude that there is still a lot to be learned.<\/p>\n<p>One more reason for blockchain education is the fact that up to 99% of Bitcoin addresses have no Bitcoin wealth. This means that 99% of Bitcoin addresses possess only one-tenth of a Bitcoin, which is worth less than $655 USD worth at present. Many Bitcoin addresses are dead, abandoned, or lost because of forgetting passwords\/keys\/usernames, or because of hackers having cracked them.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2811 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Blockchain-distribution-by-address-at-block-350000.png\" alt=\"Blockchain distribution by address at block 350,000\" width=\"876\" height=\"451\" \/>Do you want to be among the 1% of lucky people? You definitely need a proper blockchain education.<\/p>\n<h2>Blockchain Education in Universities<\/h2>\n<p>The fact that universities are offering more and more courses and blockchain-related certificates proves that the crypto field is becoming truly powerful in all areas.<\/p>\n<p>According to Coinbase surveys, students from varying departments are becoming more and more interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain courses. Nearly half of all social sciences students are willing to attend a crypto class. One of the main for such great interest in blockchain is its potential to<span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/use-case-blockchain-implementation\"> impac<\/a>t<\/span> a variety of fields.<\/p>\n<p>Coinbase\u2019s research shows that 42 percent of 50 universities conducted at least one class on blockchain or cryptocurrency, and 22 percent of them offered several. Today, 70 percent of universities offer at least one class on the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>By the way, 17 percent of computer science students, 15 percent of economics and math students, and 11 percent of business students have already taken a crypto-related course. However, only 5 percent of social sciences students have attended such a course.<\/p>\n<p>The first course on blockchain and financial services was held by David Yermack, the finance department chair at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business in 2014. 35 students attended that course.<\/p>\n<p>As of the end of spring 2018, the number of attendees had risen to 230. As a result, the decision was made to teach the course during both semesters.<\/p>\n<p>Yermack held the class because he was interested in Bitcoin, and saw a reason to teach students at the same time that their interest in the cryptocurrency was also growing.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, corporate demand for people who understand cryptocurrency-related issues has increased. Yermack certainly knew that students would need this training for their jobs in the future, so he wanted to share his skills with them.<\/p>\n<p>Universities are establishing research centers and developing crypto courses to meet this constantly-rising demand. They believe the cryptocurrency market is worthy of serious academic study.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency courses are mostly developed in the U.S. Twenty-seven percent of universities offer at least one class, and only two \u2014 the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the National University of Singapore \u2014 offer more than one.<\/p>\n<p>Johns Hopkins University holds a business course on blockchain in order to teach students its security features, advantages, and the disadvantages of its fundamental structure.<\/p>\n<p>Princeton University was one of the first to launch an online course on \u201cBitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies\u201d in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Coursera is an online education platform for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), in which leading universities and organizations worldwide provide online courses for anyone to take for free. These include video lectures, exercises, and online interaction with teachers and other students. The courses are clearly intended for a technically oriented, hands-on audience of programmers and computer scientists.<\/p>\n<p>At Princeton, there is the possibility to attend an information-security class that focuses on secure computing systems, cryptocurrencies, the blockchain, and related economics, ethics, and legal issues.<\/p>\n<p>Cornell University hosts the highest number of blockchain classes. Among 28 courses, there are classes like The Anthropology of Money and Introduction to Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies, and Smart Contracts.<\/p>\n<p>Many engineering-oriented universities \u2014 for example, the University of Waterloo, Georgetown University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign \u2014 have added blockchain courses and programs.<\/p>\n<p>In the summer of 2018, Stanford created its Center for Blockchain Research to unite students from different departments around cryptocurrency issues.<\/p>\n<p>Schools like MIT (the Media Lab, specifically), the University of Nicosia in Cyprus, and the (unaccredited) Holberton School, an alternative, teacherless software engineering school in San Francisco, have started to issue cryptographically-signed, verifiable certificates. Some universities, including the University of Nicosia, King\u2019s College in New York, and Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, have accepted cryptocurrency for tuition payments.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this chart, which identifies schools offering multiple blockchain courses:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2812 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-courses-at-top-universities.png\" alt=\"Cryptocurrency and blockchain courses at top universities\" width=\"883\" height=\"436\" \/>In 2017, Gideon Greenspan, CEO of the blockchain platform Coin Sciences, created a list of eight conditions that must be met in order to succeed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A database<\/li>\n<li>Multiple people who are writing into that database<\/li>\n<li>Operations with an absence of trust<\/li>\n<li>No intermediaries<\/li>\n<li>Interaction between transactions<\/li>\n<li>Rules to restrict transaction performance<\/li>\n<li>Choice of validators<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Return on assets<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>MIT, in collaboration with 2U, offers a six-week online blockchain certification program. The same course also is also offered at Oxford University.<\/p>\n<p>The Atlanta-based Kingsland University offers an accredited blockchain training program for developers. The program is divided into two segments: the first four weeks are conducted in a face-to-face manner, and the other four weeks are dedicated to project work. There is an opportunity for free study for students in countries that can afford to cover the program. 275,000 students from the U.S., Singapore, Australia, and the Philippines can participate in this program. Kingsland also offers a two-day executive course.<\/p>\n<p>The Blockchain Council, a group of blockchain experts and enthusiasts, provides a self-paced training program to become a certified blockchain developer. The opportunity to learn blockchain from a vendor-neutral perspective is what distinguishes it from other training programs.<\/p>\n<p>A federation of trade unions in Singapore, the National Trading Union Congress Learning Hub (NTUC) and the Huobi Group, offers a variety of new courses on blockchain for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and fintech professionals. The program focused upon practical uses for the cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p>The London startup B9lab developed an online Certified Ethereum Developer Training program in 2016, and also offered an executive course.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2813 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Top-blockchain-education-courses.png\" alt=\"Top blockchain education courses\" width=\"622\" height=\"625\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2814 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Number-of-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-classes.png\" alt=\"Number of cryptocurrency and blockchain classes\" width=\"670\" height=\"654\" \/>Learning is Earning: A World Where Knowledge Is a Currency<\/h2>\n<p>We have always believed that learning, earning, and doing what you love are separate things. Unfortunately, in most cases, these activities are not the same subject. As a rule, we spent our younger years learning what we don\u2019t want to get a diploma in, only to work to earn money to do what we really want.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps it\u2019s time to change this scenario?<\/p>\n<p>The Institute for the Future (IFTF) and the ACT Foundation have created a project called The Ledger: a new technology that could make learning a way of earning. The \u201cLearning is Earning\u201d scheme is a descendant of the well-known game of designer and writer Jane McGonigal, a research affiliate at the Palo Alto-based IFTF.<\/p>\n<p>The ledger tracks each course you have taken in units called Edublocks, each of which represents one academic hour. You can earn Edublocks from individuals, informal groups, or a formal institution, such as a school or your workplace. Additionally, students can share their Edublocks with others.<\/p>\n<p>Each participant can get credit for learning from any point in the world, just by doing the things he or she loves. The number of earned Edublocks is shown on the participant\u2019s profile. Based on your interests and skills, employers can offer you a job.<\/p>\n<p>The application tracks the income of participants, and with provided data, generates feedback on a particular course. In this way, other people can choose the most popular and profitable subject to study in the future.<\/p>\n<p>With the Ledger, you can find sponsors for your education. Offer investors a percentage of your future income in exchange for free learning hours. Blockchain provides smart contracts \u2014self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller \u2014 that make concluding agreements easy and quick.<\/p>\n<p>The blockchain\u2019s immutable nature makes each earned Edublock a permanent part of the public record of collective work and education.<br \/>\nIn this world, learning, working, and living can be combined.<\/p>\n<h2>Where to Get Knowledge: Courses, Training, and Certification Programs in 2018-2019<\/h2>\n<p>Check out this list of the 11 best blockchain certifications, training, courses, classes &amp; tutorials that are available online.
