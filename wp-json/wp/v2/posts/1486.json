Thus far, all attempts to realize this have been made in real estate. Unfortunately, adoption has not been widespread. This is because most governments already provide a functioning property-title system, and have no urgent reason to recognize blockchain-based titles as a legal alternative. In the art and collectibles market, however, there is no existing title registry. This makes adoption much more likely, and presents a unique opportunity to prove the effectiveness of a decentralized title registry in a large market to the public. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biddable<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is supported by a consortium of online marketplaces representing 5,000 auction houses with several billion in annual sales who have agreed to adopt the standard and accept cryptocurrency exclusively through it. This means Biddable is even more likely to become an example of blockchain\u2019s potential to the broader public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, art and collectibles is an asset class that should be highly attractive to the new generation of crypto-wealth. Art has always been used by the wealthy as a store of value that is relatively stable, uncorrelated, and discrete. Holders of crypto assets have similar needs. While today, crypto assets seem to be chasing returns and diversification in the form of altcoins, these coins are highly correlated to Bitcoin, and thus a poor solution to portfolio diversification. The solution is diversification into art and collectibles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, purchasing art and collectibles today with cryptocurrency is very difficult, and certainly not private. This is because auction houses need to know they can enforce a bidder\u2019s obligation to pay for items won at auction, and they exclude anyone they cannot thoroughly vet. Biddable uses deposit escrow to remove trust from the transaction, enabling auction houses to trust and thus accept purchases from crypto-bidders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third and finally<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biddable<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has a clear need for a native token. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A deposit-escrow smart contract<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would not be trustless if it required an off-chain action by the seller. Thus, the seller must escrow the title itself in the smart contract. In turn, this title must have real-world value. In Biddable, that title has value for two reasons: (1) because the market has agreed on the standard; and (2) because it includes the best evidence of authenticity. In the case of (1), we need a token to grant to consortium members to give them a stake in the success of the standard. In the case of (2), we need to a token to grant as rewards to experts for estimating value and authenticity, which is immutably stored on each title. In order to imbue the title with true value, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biddable<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> needs rewards, which means <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biddable<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> needs a native token.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abstract<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>Biddable<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a decentralized title registry with a deeply integrated deposit-escrow system, rewards protocol for estimation of value, and a native token, <\/span><b>BidCoin.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Its first application is the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arts &amp; Collectibles (A&amp;C) auction market<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which includes art, fine wine, collectible cars, antiques, decorative arts, coins, watches, jewelry, and more. Today, over $65 billion of A&amp;C is purchased annually, half in live auctions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, buying at auction is difficult for three major reasons, which <\/span><b>Biddable<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solves:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><i>Approval:<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most auction houses require pre-auction financial disclosures from bidders to ensure bidders can pay for what they win. Besides the obvious hassle, this deters bidders who value privacy and fear dishonest auctioneers may use their information to inform fraudulent \u201cshill bidding,\u201d which drives up prices. The result is an impasse which results in lower auction participation. In many cases, potential participants are simply excluded, particularly Asian bidders in Western auctions, and the reverse. Biddable solves this using smart contracts with deposit-escrow functionality to deter false bidders while protecting buyer privacy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><i>Settlement:<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Purchasing A&amp;C often involves lengthy processing times, credit-card limits on high-value purchases, counterparty risk, one-off escrows, and other issues that make transactions difficult. Few A&amp;C sellers currently accept cryptocurrencies. \u00a0Biddable solves this by supporting major cryptocurrencies like Ether and Bitcoin in its deposit-escrow contracts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><i>Valuation &amp; Authenticity:<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0Estimating what to pay for a unique item prior to auction is difficult. In particular, buyers fear \u00a0purchase of flawed items, discovering only later that they are worthless, which leaves little recourse. In the case of A&amp;C, the most common fear is purchasing a forgery from a misinformed seller. Biddable solves this using a decentralized title registry to track ownership, combined with a rewards system to incentivize crowdsourced valuation and authentication by a community of knowledgeable experts.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Biddable<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> includes a native token that is required to use the protocol. \u00a0In particular, it is necessary to enable rewards of free tokens in order to incentivize the community of experts to authenticate titles. <\/span><b>Biddable<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is intended as an enabling protocol, not a consumer destination. While <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biddable<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will initially develop a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dapp<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help with initial adoption, any organization could create a similar application and interface, and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biddable<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will support their efforts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A title registry and transaction protocol only works insofar as it is adopted as a standard. To that end, online marketplaces, software providers, auction houses, and major collectors have come together in a consortium to support and adopt Biddable. Upon launch, holders of BidCoin will be able to purchase over $6 billion of registered A&amp;C, and bid in sales from over 5,000 auctioneers. Because it will be accepted so broadly, it will instantly become the standard for both auctions and private sales. The result will be a world in which purchasing A&amp;C is reliable, private, and easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A&amp;C<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, similar problems exist in other markets for unique items that rely heavily on live auctions for price discovery. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biddable\u2019s<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> long-term vision is to adapt the protocol to solve these problems in every category of the auction market, including residential, commercial, and agricultural real estate ($139 billion), livestock ($86 billion), used cars ($409 billion), and industrial and agricultural equipment ($91 billion). In aggregate, 2% of global GDP, or $1 trillion, sells at auction.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use of Bidcoin<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bidcoins<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are required to access the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biddable<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> protocol. In requiring <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bidcoins<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our goals are the following: \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>First<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to give ecosystem participants a vested interest in the success of the protocol by requiring them to hold tokens. \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Second<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to link usage to price appreciation, which creates network effects and drives further adoption. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Third<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to provide a recurring revenue stream for expert rewards and future protocol development. \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fourth<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and finally, to prevent abuse of the system.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Transaction Fees:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buyers must pay a transaction fee in order to acquire an SP, which shall initially be set at 1% of final sale price.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the fee will go to replenish the Community Reward Pool, initially set at 2\/3.

Rewards will either come from the Community Rewards Pool or owner bounties.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sellers will receive rewards for offering items for sale in proportion to how many bonds they have posted.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sellers will receive rewards for promoting Biddable to their clients, in proportion to the combined holdings of wallets that have previously purchased an item from the seller, integrated over a period of time to encourage holding. The intent of this is to create network effects from sellers to their existing clients. We expect auction houses to encourage their clients to use <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bidcoin<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and encourage holding through things like events with artists that are only available to clients with a sufficient threshold of tokens.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Staking<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sellers must hold <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bidcoin (\u201cpost bond\u201d)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to accept deposits. Initially, the bond requirement shall be 100% of the deposit requirement for as long as deposits are accepted on each SP. For example, a seller requires a $1,000 deposit on an item estimated at $10,000 in an auction, and wants to accept deposits for the entire promotion period starting two months prior to the sale date. The seller must also post bond of $1,000 for two months. Three bidders each make a $1,000 deposit, but this does not affect the bond. The purpose of the bond to incentivize sellers to require reasonable deposits and to deter abusive behavior like testing the market with no intention of selling. \u00a0We expect to grant early sellers sufficient tokens to stake their sales (subject to a lockup). Thereafter, sellers must either keep or acquire tokens themselves or convince others to stake on their behalf. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holders of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bidcoin<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can post bond on behalf of sellers, in the event that the seller does not have sufficient funds. In exchange, the seller transfers whatever rewards they receive to the holders. \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experts must hold <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bidcoin<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to participate in the vetting system and receive rewards (\u201cpost bond\u201d). This shall initially be set at ~$25 worth of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bidcoin<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
