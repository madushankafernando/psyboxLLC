With the meteoric rise of its use, investors often wonder: how to invest in blockchain technology? Blockchain is especially advantageous, as it solves more than one problem; it also provides numerous solutions for a variety of startups, businesses, and government entities. In this way, blockchain technology boosts efficiency, increases security, provides transparency, and reduces costs in the work processes of financial, technological, educational, or governmental spheres.<\/p>\n<p>Originally, blockchain was developed for digital currencies like BTC (Bitcoin) and used for secure currency transactions. Blockchain supporters, though, noticed the benefits of this technology and integrated it into everyday work processes through tools like e-governance and data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Wikipedia gives the following definition of blockchain technology:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1626\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Wikipedia-quote-1.jpg\" alt=\"Blockchain definition by Wikipedia\" width=\"745\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Wikipedia-quote-1.jpg 745w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Wikipedia-quote-1-350x182.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Wikipedia-quote-1-500x260.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Wikipedia-quote-1-600x312.jpg 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Wikipedia-quote-1-132x69.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\" \/>In other words, blockchain can be used by anyone who is interested in processing safe, secure transactions, whether they deal with money, supplies, or other assets in the process of transfer. When transactions within the system are completed, they are recorded in the system \u201cblock,\u201d and cannot be further changed or deleted. This is visible, and provides trust to users.<\/p>\n<p>The decentralized approach without third-party involvement or governmental control is another great benefit of using the system. This is why many industries use the blockchain platform to optimize their work processes, increase management productivity and efficiency, and provide high-level security.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s check out an overview of blockchain\u2019s main advantages:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1611\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/advantages-of-blockchain.jpg\" alt=\"Advantages of blockchain use\" width=\"1653\" height=\"1364\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/advantages-of-blockchain.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/advantages-of-blockchain-350x289.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/advantages-of-blockchain-500x413.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/advantages-of-blockchain-768x634.jpg 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/advantages-of-blockchain-600x495.jpg 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/advantages-of-blockchain-132x110.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1653px) 100vw, 1653px\" \/><br \/>\nThis type of immutable system of records allows all users to be equal, as there is no one person in charge of everything. Due to the transparency and permanence of the data blocks, all users are aware of current events and certain of the safety of their records.<\/p>\n<h2>Blockchain Implementation<\/h2>\n<p>Potential blockchain implementation in various fields and industries attracts VC (venture capital) flow for business-development purposes.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most common fields in which blockchain is applied is cryptocurrency (investments in Bitcoin, Ether, or others). Purchasing crypto coins is one of the direct ways of investing in technology. One can purchase a certain type of coin or token, and in some time, when it is listed on an exchange, it is possible to trade it, thereby gaining profit from the increased value. According to <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CoinMarketCap<\/a><\/span>, market cryptocurrency capitalization is approximately $354 billion. The most popular types of cryptocurrency are:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1612\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Cryptocurrency-Market-Capitalizations-CoinMarketCap.jpg\" alt=\"The most popular cryptocurrencies\" width=\"1156\" height=\"470\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Cryptocurrency-Market-Capitalizations-CoinMarketCap.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Cryptocurrency-Market-Capitalizations-CoinMarketCap-350x142.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Cryptocurrency-Market-Capitalizations-CoinMarketCap-500x203.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Cryptocurrency-Market-Capitalizations-CoinMarketCap-768x312.jpg 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Cryptocurrency-Market-Capitalizations-CoinMarketCap-600x244.jpg 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Cryptocurrency-Market-Capitalizations-CoinMarketCap-132x54.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1156px) 100vw, 1156px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It must be emphasized, though, that lately, investing in coins and tokens is becoming less and less popular. The reason for this tendency can be explained by the growing popularity of the various startups and ICO campaigns launched on the blockchain platform. The main thing that differentiates them is that they not only promise to increase the value of an investment, but also promote a product or service to enhance certain processes in a number of industries.<\/p>\n<p>Consequently, in addition to cryptocurrency, blockchain can be applied in the following spheres:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>banking and financial technologies<\/li>\n<li>charity and donations<\/li>\n<li>data storage and security<\/li>\n<li>education<\/li>\n<li>energy<\/li>\n<li>government and voting<\/li>\n<li>insurance<\/li>\n<li>IoT<\/li>\n<li>legal and law enforcement<\/li>\n<li>marketing and media<\/li>\n<li>medical industry and healthcare<\/li>\n<li>logistics and supply chains<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Take a closer look at the features blockchain provides in the above-mentioned industries:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1613\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blockchain-industries.jpg\" alt=\"Blockchain Use Cases\" width=\"2880\" height=\"2016\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blockchain-industries.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blockchain-industries-350x245.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blockchain-industries-500x350.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blockchain-industries-768x538.jpg 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blockchain-industries-600x420.jpg 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blockchain-industries-132x92.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Such a variety of use cases proves how much blockchain contributes to the workflow of any business.

Let\u2019s consider the main tendencies of investing.<\/p>\n<h2>Best Ways to Invest in Blockchain<\/h2>\n<p>Blockchain technology is powered by cryptocurrencies, but there are many other ways to invest in blockchain without contributing your money to digital coins. The best option, as of today, is to consider investing in blockchain startups and crowdfunding platforms. As the crypto market is filled with all kinds of scams, it is crucial to conduct precise, careful research in order to eliminate possible risks and choose the strongest options.<\/p>\n<p>As with any investment, it is crucial to do your research and understand the specific features of the underlying technology. First, you can use ICO rating sites with statistics and expert reviews to find out as much as possible about your investment options. Use thematic blogs and different cryptocurrency channels to keep up with the latest news (Box Mining, Data Dash, Tommy World Power, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>The main aspects to question are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the concept behind the project, and what problem does it solve?<\/li>\n<li>What is the industry of the project launch and how does it work?<\/li>\n<li>Is this product a competitive one? Compare the strong and weak sides of the project.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the answers fully satisfy you and provide complete, comprehensive, explicit information, then the project is worth consideration.<\/p>\n<p>Investing in startups means investing in company stocks or funds that use blockchain technology to produce a certain product or service. How should you invest in blockchain stocks? Research a number of industries that use blockchain technology because of its permanence, transparency, immutability, and better protection.<\/p>\n<p>You can choose any blockchain company to invest in! If you\u2019re a company representative or CEO and you\u2019re seeking ways to implement blockchain, start with researching and evaluating all technological advantages.
