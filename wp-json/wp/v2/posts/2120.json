Any newspaper article attracts additional attention if it mentions this technology or anything related to it: Bitcoin, digital currency, smart contracts, transactions security, data exchange, blockchain interview questions, etc. Consequently, more and more projects, companies, and organizations are implementing blockchain on different levels, and the demand for <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/how-to-become-a-blockchain-developer\">blockchain developers<\/a><\/span> grows.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a perfect candidate and defining the appropriate blockchain interview questions under such rough conditions may be a complex task. First of all, given the shortage of personnel in the market and the novelty of the industry, it is not worth reconsidering a lack of experience in this field as a disadvantage. A strong developer, especially with a proven technical base, will understand this technology in a relatively short time. Well-fitting middle-aged developers writing in Java, C \/ C ++, Go, Python, and Rust are ready to learn and apply their own knowledge in the digital currency field.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2122 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/U.K.-Blockchain-Developer-Average-Salary.png\" alt=\"Blockchain Developers average salary\" width=\"797\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/U.K.-Blockchain-Developer-Average-Salary.png 797w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/U.K.-Blockchain-Developer-Average-Salary-350x205.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/U.K.-Blockchain-Developer-Average-Salary-500x293.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/U.K.-Blockchain-Developer-Average-Salary-768x450.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/U.K.-Blockchain-Developer-Average-Salary-600x352.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/U.K.-Blockchain-Developer-Average-Salary-132x77.png 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It is better to hire developers who are part of the fast-growing <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bitcoin blockchain community<\/a><\/span>. Such specialists constantly participate in various conferences, meetups, and other events for the purpose of self-education. Today, the bitcoin community is actively developing new concepts of digital currency technology.<\/p>\n<p>Another promising resource is talented graduates of leading technical universities. Special attention should be paid to the winners of international olympiads in mathematics and programming; a talent for solving non-standard problems greatly facilitates work with blockchain. A serious advantage will be the availability of knowledge in the field of applied cryptography.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2123\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Blockchain-Developer-Skill-Set.png\" alt=\"Blockchain Developer Skill Set\" width=\"653\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Blockchain-Developer-Skill-Set.png 653w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Blockchain-Developer-Skill-Set-350x312.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Blockchain-Developer-Skill-Set-500x446.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Blockchain-Developer-Skill-Set-600x536.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Blockchain-Developer-Skill-Set-123x110.png 123w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to professionalism and mathematical abilities, an innovative approach and ambition are important characteristics. There are no ready-made solutions for a number of tasks, and blockchain developers often have to make decisions on their own. Routine work and standard tasks are not features of this sphere, so a good test task for a future blockchain developer should contain a challenge &#8211; the requirement to go beyond the competencies of the candidate.<\/p>\n<p>Note that excellent developers have a good reputation. So, before interviewing a candidate, be sure to talk with his or her former employers. Also, carefully study his or her portfolio from previous jobs to see if it is compatible with the design of your project. A good developer should know the basic trends in the development of systems based on blockchain technology, relevant protocols, basic programming languages, digital currency basics, tools, and software development methods that are widely used at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most important factors to consider when hiring a blockchain developer is mutual psychological compatibility. Certainly, a quality contributor is important in all spheres of business, but it is in the sphere of blockchain that their absence has a particularly strong effect on the results achieved. There are various ways to achieve this goal, including hiring people with a common background (i.e., from one university or community). Competent and careful team-building takes into account the personal characteristics of the candidate as well as their psychological makeup.<\/p>\n<h3>Incentives for Blockchain Developers<\/h3>\n<p>So far, demand in the market for vacancies in the field of blockchain significantly exceeds supply. Candidates have the opportunity to choose, and their motivation is not limited to high wages. One of the most powerful motivating factors is intellectual and professional growth &#8211; active participation in the development of an industry, and solving interesting and complex issues. The intellectual specifics of this business also determine the nature of incentives: options, the possibility of continuous improvement of professional skills, participation in conferences and other events at the global level, and support for the initiative.<\/p>\n<p>For many developers, a strong argument when choosing a company becomes the opportunity to work remotely, but if you organize a comfortable workspace, blockchain developers will be interested in working from the office. Pleasant bonuses, such as a gym, free meals, and assistance with various issues &#8211; in general, a high basic level of comfort that allows the team to focus on its immediate tasks &#8211; can encourage a candidate to accept a work proposition.<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, a winning option for attracting and retaining valuable personnel is attention to personal goals. For talented people (after all, you want<span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/how-to-find-best-ico-developers-when-launching-ico\"> to find them<\/a><\/span>), it is especially important that they will be accepted as they are. Providing an individualized approach to each, you will find loyal employees who are ready to work with your team for many years. The latter will be especially valuable. Blockchain fever continues, which means that the demand for good specialists is unlikely to fall in the next few years.<\/p>\n<h2>Hiring a Blockchain Developer<\/h2>\n<p>Today, many organizations and companies (financial institutions and startups) are exploring the possibility of introducing blockchain technology into their business processes. Therefore, knowing how to identify a truly professional and experienced specialist to develop a new system is critical to the success of the project.<\/p>\n<p>A good developer should know basic trends in the underlying technology, relevant protocols, basic programming languages, tools, and software development methods that are widely used at the moment. The perfect candidate should have at least 3+ years of development experience with C\/C ++\/Go\/Rust\/Java\/Python\/Ruby\/C#\/Solidity, etc.<\/p>\n<p>This list is infinite, so to find good specialists, you may need to determine first the qualities and knowledge you need him or her to possess and then define what blockchain interview questions you may need to ask.<\/p>\n<p>Below, we will list the most important blockchain developer interview questions, cryptocurrency interview questions, and bitcoin interview questions that need to be asked in the process of finding a developer for your <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/ico-cabinet\/\">decentralized network<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h3>Blockchain Interview Questions<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What is blockchain, and why is it innovative?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Blockchain is an absolutely new, decentralized, safe, and transparent solution that allows the storage and exchange of information, determination of its authenticity, and a low price. In this technology, everything is done by the user, so the transaction does not require the participation of a third trustee. It is the absence of an intermediary that is the main innovation and originality of the distributed ledger. The most famous application of blockchain technology is digital currency: crypto assets or digital money like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc. This technology can also be used in many other areas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does blockchain provide security and transparency of transactions?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Without a doubt, blockchain interview questions should contain questions about transactions security and how it is achieved.<\/p>\n<p>Technically, this is achieved by sequentially encrypting data about each forthcoming transaction. Any transaction entered into a block is assigned a cryptographic identifier (hash) that is added to the header of the record for the next transaction, and this is repeated permanently so that the transaction hash on the vertex of the chain contains encrypted data about all previous operations written in the block. It\u2019s not possible to change an already-recorded transaction, as this will compromise the entire chain.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2125 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Blockchain.png\" alt=\"Ethereum Blockchain\" width=\"1048\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Blockchain.png 1048w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Blockchain-132x73.png 132w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Blockchain-350x194.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Blockchain-500x278.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Blockchain-768x427.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Blockchain-1024x569.png 1024w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Blockchain-600x333.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Blockchain-120x67.png 120w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Blockchain-300x167.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" \/>What types of blockchain do you know?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are <em>public<\/em> (open to all users), <em>private<\/em> (with restricted access), and<em> hybrid<\/em> (the combination of two previous types) blockchains.<\/p>\n<p><em>Private<\/em> blockchain is a chain of blocks that can be created by a limited circle of persons who have confirmed rights for it. The rights may belong to one or more persons (or one or several organizations). Creation of new blocks in such a system is controlled by one or several nodes.<\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, in the <em>public<\/em> blockchain, a chain of blocks can be created by any user (as in the mining of Bitcoins). It is open for all, and no one controls it.<\/p>\n<p><em>Hybrid<\/em> blockchain is a combination of two previous types.

Consensus is a mathematical algorithm used to guarantee that all nodes agree about the true and real state of the blockchain network, and to avoid any risk of digital currency double-spending. To provide protection, there are a number of consensus algorithms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Proof of Work<\/em>: Users have to perform a hash algorithm several times or calculate a mathematical puzzle according to a certain algorithm to confirm electronic transactions. In the Bitcoin network, Bitcoins are put into circulation by paying compensation to miners who successfully created new blocks.<\/li>\n<li><em>Proof of Burn<\/em>: Based on the principle of \u201cburning\u201d or \u201cdestroying\u201d the coins owned by the miners who give them mining rights.<\/li>\n<li><em>Proof of Stake<\/em>: The user must have some amount of cryptocurrency if he or she wants to claim the confirmation of additional blocks in the middle, and get paid for it.<\/li>\n<li><em>Proof of Possession (Proof of Hold)<\/em>: The more money the user has, the more rights he or she has to carry out the audit.<\/li>\n<li><em>Proof of Use<\/em>: The more the user is exchanging currency, the more rights he or she has to carry out an audit.<\/li>\n<li><em>Proof of Importance<\/em>: Users who have the highest confirmation of rates in the cryptocurrency will be rewarded.<\/li>\n<li><em>Delegated Proof of Stake (<\/em>DPoS<em>)<\/em>: Consensus uses a reputation system recruited through voting to select a limited group of people who are trusted. Only such people have the right to record blocks and do it in a random order. All owners of tokens can vote, and votes are weighed by the number of coins that the voter owns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2126\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Mining-Proof-of-Work-with-Java.png\" alt=\"Mining Proof of Work with Java\" width=\"940\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Mining-Proof-of-Work-with-Java.png 940w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Mining-Proof-of-Work-with-Java-350x151.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Mining-Proof-of-Work-with-Java-500x215.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Mining-Proof-of-Work-with-Java-768x331.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Mining-Proof-of-Work-with-Java-600x259.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Mining-Proof-of-Work-with-Java-132x57.png 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How does the blockchain work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To create and work on the blockchain, one needs a registry (a row of blocks, for example, Bitcoin), encryption with keys to protect the transaction, a consensus algorithm for verifying transactions, and a peer-to-peer network to make everything work.

Here are a few reasons why people use the Bitcoin network:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the main benefit of using Bitcoin is a simple and fast way to carry out payments all over the world;<\/li>\n<li>the cost of an ordinary bank transfer is higher than a transaction in the Bitcoin network;<\/li>\n<li>hackers can steal your payment information from the operator of an ordinary payment system, but theft of Bitcoin&#8217;s payment addresses is absolutely useless, as the transaction becomes valid only if it is signed by a private key, which does not need to be transmitted somewhere in order to do a payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Bitcoin-blockchain.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin blockchain\" width=\"769\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Bitcoin-blockchain.png 769w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Bitcoin-blockchain-350x208.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Bitcoin-blockchain-500x297.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Bitcoin-blockchain-768x456.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Bitcoin-blockchain-600x357.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Bitcoin-blockchain-132x78.png 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How does the Bitcoin blockchain work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin interview questions should also include interview questions concerning its functioning.<\/p>\n<p>The process of its formation and functioning is divided into four stages:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Two participants agree on the terms of a transaction (transfer of money, assets, financial documents, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>The registry is &#8220;scanned&#8221; by members of the network.

It is a complex system of information and technological procedures built on cryptographic methods of protection, regulating the identification of owners and fixing the fact of their change.<\/p>\n<p>The issue and accounting of cryptocurrency is based on asymmetric encryption and the use of various cryptographic methods of protection.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Ethereum?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All blockchain developers must be familiar with <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ethereum.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ethereum<\/a><\/span>, so be sure to include it to your cryptocurrency interview questions. Ethereum is a decentralized platform built for a smart-contract execution. Smart contracts are programmable applications that work without the possibility of censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. These applications run on user blockchains in a distributed global infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2135\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Proof-of-Stake-1.png\" alt=\"Ethereum Proof of Stake\" width=\"1010\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Proof-of-Stake-1.png 1010w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Proof-of-Stake-1-132x56.png 132w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Proof-of-Stake-1-350x149.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Proof-of-Stake-1-500x212.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Proof-of-Stake-1-768x326.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Proof-of-Stake-1-600x255.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Proof-of-Stake-1-120x51.png 120w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Ethereum-Proof-of-Stake-1-300x127.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1010px) 100vw, 1010px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Contracts created in Ethereum are based on a protocol related to information technology and allow verification or enforcement of a bilateral treaty. These contracts are unfoldable and available for public discussion inside the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for building blockchain applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What language is used for smart-contract creation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In Ethereum, every smart contract enters the blockchain using a special <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-developer-interview\">Solidity<\/a><\/span> language. Solidity is a complex programming language whose syntax resembles JavaScript. It was developed to assemble the code for Ethereum virtual machines. Being a complete Turing language, Solidity allows the writing of both simple and rather complex programs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a fork?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Forks refer to the fact that different users have to utilize general regulatory principles to support blockchain record history.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a hard fork\/soft fork? Do you know any vulnerability cases regarding hard\/soft forks?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In blockchain technology, a hard fork is a complete transformation of protocol, as a result of which formerly invalid blocks\/transactions become valid (or vice-versa). For instance, in June 2016, a hacker broke the code of the DAO smart contract due to a recursive calling <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/history-of-ethereum-security-vulnerabilities-hacks-and-their-fixes\">vulnerability<\/a><\/span>. To solve the problem, in July 2016, Ethereum resorted to a hard fork &#8211; editing the code of the blockchain in order to restore the stolen assets of the DAO project and transfer it to the owners.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike a hard fork, a soft fork is a modification of the rules that creates blocks identified as a valid old software.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a 51% attack?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An 51% attack possibility occurs when an individual or a group of people controls more than half of the processing power given for mining. He or she(they) can reject or approve transactions, and also perform double expenses. Indeed, the nodes of the network (the Bitcoin blockchain, for instance) recognize as legal the longest chain that will be written by a group of miners with the largest processing power.<\/p>\n<p>If such an attack took place, it is likely that the network would quickly recognize this fact.<\/p>\n<h3>A Final Word<\/h3>\n<p>Finding an experienced blockchain developer is not an easy task, as the digital currency technology itself is fresh and complicated. Blockchain interview questions should raise a huge number of extremely important issues. And this is not taking into account the wide discussion of its potential use cases or benefits, such as refusal from the third parties, protection of transactions, sharing resources, economies of scale, transaction guarantees, automatic execution of contracts, and decentralization of the process.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today blockchain is as popular as it has never been.
