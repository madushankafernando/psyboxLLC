This type of documentation is essential for avoiding insecurities.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the presence of this document plays an important role, many <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain development <\/span>companies do not develop it. However, experienced engineers say that a set of specifications helps them clarify all complicated issues and describe the operation of each feature of the smart contract, thereby increasing the chances for the project&#8217;s success.<\/p>\n<p>When preparing specifications, a <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart contract development company should <\/span>provide insights into the expected behavior of the smart contract: what should occur, and what should not. For this, it is worth building diagrams to come up with possible alternatives and finding existing inaccuracies in the smart contract. Commenting on the complicated sections of the smart contract will also help to clarify your intentions.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid failures, record all data of the <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solidity smart contract development and <\/span>deployment process. Well-prepared documentation that describes the order of operations in a smart contract (the type of compiler used and the construction parameters for the initialization of each contract) will help avoid unnecessary problems, especially for a <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeFi development company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A qualitatively-written smart contract greatly simplifies and automates the work of the <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart contract audit company you will hire<\/span>. Also, do not forget to delete unused and unnecessary files, code snippets, and even some contracts. This will reduce the volume of clutter and simplify the auditor\u2019s work.<\/p>\n<p>It is recommended to use Solidity Coverage to audit smart contracts if we are talking about the Ethereum <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain development company<\/span>. This helps to evaluate test coverage and identify each piece of code that hasn\u2019t yet been tested, and analyze it much more deeply.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, coverage can fix several security bugs, but you have to provide a professional smart contract from the very beginning.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blockchain-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blockchain developers<\/a> to improve the efficiency of smart contracts facilitate their reading and evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>When testing a smart contract, static analysis helps <a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-technology\/history-of-ethereum-security-vulnerabilities-hacks-and-their-fixes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to reveal code vulnerabilities<\/a>. Use tools like Oyente, Manticore, or Solgraph to analyze smart-contract code and detect common security issues.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the fact that smart contract development is quite widespread and simple, contracts can still contain bugs; therefore, one should always be ready for failure. That\u2019s why you need to protect yourself by creating an effective update plan for discovering the code bugs if there are any. The best option would be to hire a <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart contract audit company to make sure everything is handled professionally.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart-Contract Dangers: Catch the Signal to Rescue Your Project<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we are talking about the application of smart contracts (<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dApps development services, for instance) <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in order to attract investments, founders need to understand the necessity of project due diligence, particularly technical audits of smart contracts. Making your smart-contract code bulletproof is the key to building business credibility in the blockchain development ecosystem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1802.06038.pdf\">report<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> generated in 2018 by researchers from Singapore and the U.K., approximately 34,200 out of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">970,898 smart contracts<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (worth over $4 million) are vulnerable to technical bugs. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without multi-layered evaluation of project feasibility (particularly verification of technical aspects) and smart contract audit company that provides further identification and mitigation of possible risks, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/token-offerings\/create-smart-contract-for-your-ico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">every smart contract you create and deploy<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could be an easy target for hackers. In order to remain confident of the validity of your code and maintain assurances of protection from errors and omissions, make sure your smart contract is checked by the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/shop\/auditing\/expert-recommendations-and-report-for-your-smart-contract\">best smart contract audit company<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that will follow coding standards and reveal spelling errors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Smart-Contract Audit Phases<\/h2>\n<p>The key tasks of a smart contract audit company include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Finding common errors such as stack, compilation, and reentry difficulties<\/li>\n<li>Discovering errors of the host platform<\/li>\n<li>Learning current and possible security issues<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When <a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/shop\/auditing\/expert-recommendations-and-report-for-your-smart-contract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">auditing smart contracts<\/a>, a <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain development company<\/span> can follow either manual or automatic methods of code analysis.<\/p>\n<p>The manual approach has many benefits. If a project has a large and<a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blockchain-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> professional development team<\/a>, a manual approach to outline improvements related to efficiency, logic, and optimization of the smart contract is a perfect choice.<\/p>\n<p>Team members of a <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart contract audit company<\/span> must examine every piece of code, as the safety of the smart contract is the most important section to pay attention to in order to provide successful and lasting functioning of a <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain development company<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast to a manual audit of the smart contract, the automatic method is less time-consuming and allows testing for vulnerabilities much more quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can benefit from smart-contract audits: developers, owners of ICO startups, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeFi development company, <\/span>and owners of <a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-technology\/blockchain-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the decentralized applications<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>The Importance of the Smart-Contract Audit<\/h2>\n<p>Since the spread of popularity of token offerings and other related blockchain projects, smart contract audits has become one of the most in-demand services in the blockchain development sphere. And it\u2019s no wonder.<\/p>\n<p>Smart contract security plays a significant role in the success of the whole project, as it must be a priority in order to prevent any possible risks after code implementation.<\/p>\n<p>A smart contract audit is an important stage for any <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain development agency<\/span>, as investors and owners trust their cryptocurrency and\/or tokens. It can help:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>give more confidence to investors that the contract takes into account and protects their interests<\/li>\n<li>provide an additional guarantee that the smart contract code does not contain mistakes for a hacker to steal funds or block them. Additionally, some exchanges can request an audit before adding a token to their lists.<\/li>\n<li>receive higher ratings on IEO trackers and listings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some problems can cause bugs in the smart contract code, which is a bad situation, as nothing can be fixed anymore. Because of the irreversible nature of smart contracts, money can be lost on the blockchain, and there may not be any possibility of getting it back.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, even a tiny vulnerability or misstep can be decisive. That\u2019s why serious project developers prefer hiring a professional <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart contract audit company<\/span> to have their smart contracts tested properly. Developers know that the elimination of smart contract problems can be really costly, so an audit shouldn\u2019t be skipped, as it is the best way to save time and money.<\/p>\n<p>Smart contracts must be carefully planned, taking into account all logical permutations and possible exceptions. If someone changes the order of the code (as in the case of a DAO attack) or forgets to initialize something (as in the case of Parity Freeze), he or she can perpetuate a catastrophe on the immutable blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>The blockchain is still developing, so many new <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coin launch platforms <\/span>have appeared, but the security of code is still an eternal issue in programming that will always be relevant.<\/p>\n<p>A smart contract audit is a prerequisite for any project to be considered safe and be suitable for trading on exchanges.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, customers are trusting you with a lot of their money, so you are responsible for their savings. If someone hacks the network, all of their money will be lost. It is vital to reveal and warn about bugs and inefficiency problems in smart contracts. Protect your investors by hiring experts in the <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain development <\/span>field. They must be experienced in both smart-contract programming and security.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, lack of experience and the absence of deliberate and rigorously-thought-out project preparation and lack of technical knowledge are the reasons startups lack credibility.
