Binance Smart Chain delivers approximately 3 second block times using the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. The Proof of Staked Authority (or PoSA) allows participants to stake Binance coins to become validators. Users receive transaction fees from the transactions included in every valid block they propose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike many protocols, there is no block subsidy of freshly-mined BNB, as BNB is not inflationary. However, the supply of BNB decreases over time because the Binance team usually does coin burns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Proof of Staked Authority<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proof of Staked Authority provides more than 50 percent protection against certain types of malicious activity from hackers. It is a reliable method for keeping the BSC safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Governance\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The governance feature of BSC has the following attributes:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Uniform Interface:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The smart contracts interested in specific parameters only need to implement algorithms using the same interface.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Extensibility:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The addition of a new system contract does not require modifying previous or existing contracts<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Failure Tolerance:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The system makes it effortless for validators to vote and skip false proposals and move on without further delay.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Multiplexing:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Even though there is Governance for parameters only, there is room for more governance functions in the future.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Benefits of building projects on BSC<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Interoperability<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dual smart chain architecture of Binance Smart Chain makes it easy to transfer assets from one blockchain to another blockchain. This flexibility makes it effortless for users to access a cast ecosystem with diverse use cases without limitations. DeFi proponents highly value interoperability, and Binance Smart Chain brings that to the forefront.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Cheaper Transactions<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain fees known as transaction fees are paid by users when conducting transactions on a blockchain. This fee, often collected by miners or validators, is paid for their duty or ensuring that the blockchain only allows, records and processes valid transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many dApps carry out a wide range of transactions which comes with transaction fees for every exchange. This is why many people consider this an essential factor to consider when choosing a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain for decentralized finance<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> protocol.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When compared to the Ethereum blockchain fees, the Binance Smart Chain is realistically more cost-effective than Ethereum. For example, Ethereum has recorded a transaction fee of more than $100 for a single transaction, while Binance Smart Chain charges between $0.01 to $0.05 for the same services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Transaction Speed<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a transaction to be successful on the blockchain, there are many confirmations necessary to take place for complete processing. These confirmations serve as a means of preventing erroneous transactions such as double-spending. The longer the confirmation time, the more time it takes for a transaction to be processed entirely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoiding unnecessary delays during transcription is a crucial factor developers consider before settling for a blockchain protocol.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum has become affected by scalability issues in recent times, leading to congestions and longer waiting times for transactions to be processed entirely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Binance Smart Chain was uniquely designed to enhance blockchain scalability with ultra-fast processing speed for effortless implementation of smart contracts to build scalable, user-friendly, decentralized applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By improving the existing structure of Binance Chain, a high performance, low latency blockchain, the Binance Chain was built to enhance speed but unable to handle smart contracts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, BSC is compatible with Smart contracts for dApps, and it is connected with the high-speed throughput Binance Chain providing a powerful parallel chain with synergistic algorithms that are programmable, allow shorter confirmation time, and faster transaction processed speed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What are some drawbacks of BSC?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Consensus Mechanism:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) allows the blockchain to achieve its fast block times, but many critics argue that this can lead to centralization. This is because the system allows only people who can meet the financial requirement to be eligible as a validator, therefore, cutting out a large number of community members and putting the responsibility in the hands of a few privileged people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Collusion:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There is a risk of validators colluding to alter the blockchain maliciously. However, a huge penalty awaits them if they should do this, such as affecting their fees or their staked assets, so, likely, they won&#8217;t do that even though the possibility still exists in theory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Popular projects on BSC<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With dApps, we have different cryptocurrency wallets that function using the Binance Smart Chain. Now that we&#8217;ve got a wallet with crypto coins let&#8217;s examine this powerful tool&#8217;s possibilities. Here are some of the popular decentralized applications on the Binance Smart Chain platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to state that these are just a few examples of the successful ones. There is a continuous launch of new and exciting dApps, and you can check them out on DappRaddar, DefiStation, or the Math dApp Store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>PancakeSwap<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PancakeSwap ranks number one as the automated market maker (AMM) on the Binance Smart Chain platform. Like Sushi swap or Uniswap, users can do token exchanges for BEP-20 tokens on the PancakeSwap framework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides, you can provide liquidity to one or more of the liquidity pools and earn passive income in the process. It&#8217;s vital to consider impermanent loss before you deposit your funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though at the core of PancakeSwap is AMM, there are also other uses of the platform. For example, you can take part in a lottery, win NFTs, sell tokens, compete for available spots on the leaderboard, and lots more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Venus\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venus is another dApp making the news on BSC. This peer-to-peer borrowing and lending protocol is similar to compound or Aave on Ethereum. This decentralized money market allows users to borrow and lend BEP-20 tokens with an interest rate set within the algorithm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have some idle funds you are not using anytime soon; Venus can be a platform where you can earn interest on them or use them as collateral to borrow against to participate in a yield farm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also enables a decentralized stable coin, the VAI. The coin is backed by many crypto assets making it similar to MakerDao and Compound on a BSC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Autofarm<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a yield generator on BSC. It is a hybrid of Yearn on Ethereum. The dApp automatically helps you discover an optimal way to earn on your deposited funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>BurgerSwap<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is also another popular AMM on BSC that allows you to swap your BEP-20 token and provide liquidity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Spartan Protocol<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spartan Protocol works as a synthetic protocol for your assets on BSC. It makes it possible for users to create liquidity pools for BEP-20 tokens, just like other available AMMs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can also expand its usefulness in the future to areas such as creating synthetic assets with liquidity pools as collateral and lending and on-chain derivatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Cream<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cream is unique because it is a popular lending protocol on Ethereum deployed in the Basic Smart Chain platform. It is used for borrowing and lending the BEP-20 tokens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Migrating projects to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offers a wide range of benefits to the users.
