Nowadays, in 2019, a new alternative, IEO, has arisen as a new level of coin-offering transformation. Is an IEO a justifiable alternative for an ICO? Read our article on <a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/token-offerings\/initial-exchange-offerings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">initial coin offering explained<\/a>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>So, <a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/token-offerings\/ico-meaning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What Is an ICO?<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>An<a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/token-offerings\/how-to-launch-initial-coin-offering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> ICO<\/a> is a recently emerged concept of crowdfunding projects in the cryptocurrency and <a href=\"https:\/\/pixelprivacy.com\/resources\/what-is-the-blockchain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blockchain<\/a> industries. It allows funding of projects through the sale of tokens or crypto coins, which are similar to\u00a0IPOs. There are some differences. The first is that instead of selling shares to the public for money, a company distributes its own cryptocurrency called \u201ctokens\u201d to the investors in exchange for existing cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin or Ethereum). The tokens can usually be resold immediately. To illustrate, Singapore-based company TenX managed to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bitcoinist.com\/tenx-ico-raises-34-million-7-minutes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raise $34 million<\/a>\u00a0in 7 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>What is the incentive for the investors to fund an ICO project?\u00a0It is obvious: the motivation is that the price of the token would be much higher than the token\u2019s price during the ICO. They can trade them on the public cryptocurrency exchanges, like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kraken.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kraken<\/a> or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/poloniex.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Poloniex<\/a>, to obtain a considerable increase of the tokens.<\/p>\n<p>The other crucial distinction is that the IPO is under strict government regulation and security. Therefore, its shares require preparation of large amounts of paperwork before being released. In such a case, cryptocurrency crowdfunding has an enormous preference due to its unrestricted scope. You can set up an ICO almost everywhere and at any time. However, such opportunities carry new risks both to the ICO team and investors. Before we highlight the hottest aspects of launching an ICO project, read the article about <a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/token-offerings\/successful-icos-conducted-by-applicature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top ICOs carried out by Applicature<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/token-offerings\/how-to-launch-initial-coin-offering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Set up an ICO project?<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>When starting a crowdsale of tokens, one should consider whether it can be organically integrated into the business model of the product. Well-organized project economics and integration of the token into the company structure will make your token popular and will promote investors\u2019 attraction. This information should be described in detail on the website and in White Paper.<\/p>\n<p>To raise the necessary amount of money for your project implementation is not enough.

And then you can proceed to the technical matters of the project elaboration.<\/p>\n<p>There are some crucial aspects while preparing for an ICO campaign. Some ICOs have a competent team and elaborated scheme of project implementation and further development. But their marketing strategy hasn\u2019t established a qualitative relationship with a key audience for the project, blockbuster enthusiasts, traders, investors, etc. To make the project successful and overwhelming one should understand the ICO milestones. Before <a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/token-offerings\/technical-components-ico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">starting an ICO project it is worth understanding of a technical structure<\/a> of the whole mechanism.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s consider them on the examples of the most trending ICOs running this summer 2017.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Projects\u2019 Goal: Defined and Realistic One Will Lend Credibility of the Investors<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The core pillars of the cryptocurrency community are transparency and authenticity reflected in the clear-cut goals. According to crypto industry standard, the project has to demonstrate its work-in-progress stages. Every product needs to have its own business card. The website is definitely one of the main open sources of information for potential supporters.<\/p>\n<p>White papers and roadmap are key mechanisms in the world of blockchain technology. The purpose of a <a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/token-offerings\/write-good-white-paper-ico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">white paper<\/a> is to promote a certain product, service, technology or methodology, and to influence current and prospective customers&#8217; decisions. It is an informational document which aims to outline the technical features of the product to experts and opinion leaders, professionals and enthusiasts\u2019 community. White papers are designed to be used as a marketing tool before a sale.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-are-the-best-techniques-to-create-a-product-roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">roadmap<\/a> has to list clearly defined and realistically achievable goals and their time frames.

Let\u2019s consider them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>discounts, premiums, and bounty programs<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is a must-rule, in the first few days of the campaign investors get discounts.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>returning the funds in the case of failure<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You should also take into consideration that there is always a probability of fiasco of your goals and targets. It is imperative to be a cautious player on the multiple-choice scene. There are always scammers who can affect your reputation and fail your purpose. Therefore, you have to be always ready for returning the funds to their contributors.<\/p>\n<h3>Incentivize the Audience with Discounts and Bounty Programs!<\/h3>\n<p>As a rule, there are bonuses and discounts for early-bird investors. Defining the terms for investors would be reasonable before launching an ICO. To visualize this aspect of running an ICO, we suggest reviewing the most trending summertime ICOs.<br \/>\n<strong>TenX.<\/strong><br \/>\nAccording to the white paper, there are such bonus and bounty programs:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>TenX Initial Token Sale Bonus Schedule:<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>One (1) ETH will give you 350 PAY tokens. That means that one PAY token is worth 1\/350 ETH. Extra tokens are offered as a bonus for users who commit earlier (early-bird bonus).

Your reputation depends on the ability to protect investor\u2019s rights. A good example is Enigma\u2019s recent red flag: the hackers nab around $500,000. The attacker gained access to Enigma\u2019s Slack community, website and some of its mailing lists to posts the messages, apparently because CEO Guy Zyskind had not changed a previously compromised password for his email account.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4551\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-07-15-at-21.50.34.png\" alt=\"ico-projects\" width=\"868\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-07-15-at-21.50.34.png 868w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-07-15-at-21.50.34-132x34.png 132w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-07-15-at-21.50.34-350x90.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-07-15-at-21.50.34-500x128.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-07-15-at-21.50.34-768x197.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-07-15-at-21.50.34-600x154.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-07-15-at-21.50.34-120x31.png 120w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-07-15-at-21.50.34-300x77.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Despite the team\u2019s poor security that caused such an incident, this was a good decision to refund ICO investors.<\/p>\n<h2>PR Strategy and Marketing the ICO campaign<\/h2>\n<p>It is crucial to establish a qualitative relationship with supporting community on social networks (Slack, Twitter, Telegram, Facebook) and blog platforms (Medium).<\/p>\n<p>Not quantity, but quality. You can own many channels of communication, but the main point is the strategy you invent. Remember that ICOs are becoming competitive. Develop amazing content formats. This may help you to compel investors via social communities.<\/p>\n<p>We covered the most reasonable marketing instruments below to show their determinant role before setting up an ICO. Let\u2019s consider some current ICOs and their <a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/ico-marketing-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketing strategy while running token offerings<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Social Networks (Facebook, Twitter)<\/h3>\n<p>If you decided to launch an ICO, your campaign should be comprehensive in the administration of social networks, providing all the solid information about the project and the campaign. Timely posts and appearances in mass media are also the part of presentable ICO.<\/p>\n<h3>Community Discussions in Slack and Telegram<\/h3>\n<p>Slack and Telegram are the most important channels of communication. It\u2019s a big community connecting project founders, users, investors, and team members. Feeling the atmosphere within these communities can be relevant when evaluating the ICO project. What is important? It is time management; raised questions in the community must be answered in time and on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<h3>Medium Blog<\/h3>\n<p>Medium is a perfect location of information about the project itself, its terms and conditions, roadmap and future perspectives, development and current activity of an ICO. A number of your followers depends on the post frequency, activity in the blog, captivating info.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/image5.png\" alt=\"Medium blog\" width=\"703\" height=\"587\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/image5.png 703w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/image5-350x292.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/image5-500x417.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/image5-600x501.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/image5-132x110.png 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Threads on Bitcointalk.org<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcointalk.org <\/a>is an enormous Blockchain platform about Bitcoin and related issues. Creation of the campaign on this forum is imperative, as it provides you direct interaction with the traders and investors, with the targeted audience who are introduced to the developers. Bitcointalk is a mixture of negative and positive reviews of the projects. However, critical points of view can be favorable in improving and fixing your project.<\/p>\n<p>Collaboration with the investors and the audience is strongly recommended. Read the messages carefully, trying to answer all types of questions. Do not avoid negative comments, always monitor them and be involved in the communication process.<\/p>\n<h3>PR in Mass Media<\/h3>\n<p>Promotion of the project in mass media is fundamental in the creation of positive opinion and announcement of the team success, expertness, and reliability. The media is the central vehicle of PR industry, means of communication with the public. Therefore, the PR campaign should launch at least 3 months before the setting up an ICO. Build the ongoing relations with journalists and reporters.<\/p>\n<p>PR manager who promotes the project has to know key marketing instruments:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"c31 lst-kix_g7yqvv83urx-0 start\">\n<li>press releases and post-event articles<\/li>\n<li>publications in the media<\/li>\n<li>video and audio news releases<\/li>\n<li>events and conferences, meetups<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The press release is\u00a0&gt;one of the basic instruments for supplying content to the media. It can be quickly spread in different publications. They are recommended to be written by professionals, concerning the crypto theme.<\/p>\n<h3>YouTube<\/h3>\n<p>This channel of communication can be a good alternative for written information within the mass media publications. People prefer vlogs to see the person talking to them. Video news is easier to grasp, and it has a tangible effect on apprehension and realization. Make your own channel for public interests, and you\u2019ll see how the news is circulated.<\/p>\n<h3>Bounty campaign<\/h3>\n<p>Bounty programs are the zest of an ICO project. They motivate the users for certain PR promotion in exchange for tokens reward. Everyone may participate in this kind of reward campaign. Tokens can be paid, for example, for social activity, website translation, writing the articles and blog posts on the project or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tenx.tech\/whitehat.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">submitting secure vulnerabilities.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>There is a variety of ICO-trackers, where your project can be on the list. For example,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ico-list.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ICO-list<\/a>. Its preference is in extra related platforms located together with the names of ICO projects.<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate qualitative marketing strategy, let\u2019s review current relevant ICO
