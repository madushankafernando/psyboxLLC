The scalability of the IDO investment has been skyrocketing over the last few months. It is not an easy task to launch your own IDO campaign, though; you will need to overcome hidden pitfalls. These difficulties can be defined as follows:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1343\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Competition-between-ICO-investment-launching-campaigns.png\" alt=\"Competition between ICO investment launch campaigns\" width=\"1590\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Competition-between-ICO-investment-launching-campaigns.png 1590w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Competition-between-ICO-investment-launching-campaigns-350x103.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Competition-between-ICO-investment-launching-campaigns-500x147.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Competition-between-ICO-investment-launching-campaigns-768x226.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Competition-between-ICO-investment-launching-campaigns-1024x301.png 1024w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Competition-between-ICO-investment-launching-campaigns-600x177.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Competition-between-ICO-investment-launching-campaigns-132x39.png 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1590px) 100vw, 1590px\" \/><br \/>\nThe main goal of an IDO project is to launch a fundraising mechanism. The tokens created during an IDO will fund your business or brand-new startup by investing money in digital assets in order to create an exchange of profit or buy cryptocurrency. If you define all key objectives of the project clearly to the community, you can be confident of the success of your IDO campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>Initial Coin Offering Services, or How to Invest in an IDO<\/h2>\n<p>The general plan for launching an IDO includes: generating an idea for your project, <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/write-good-white-paper-ico\" rel=\"noopener\">working out a good white paper<\/a><\/span>, building a roadmap, starting a marketing campaign, developing a smart contract, testing, and launching a crowdsale. People amazed by the project idea become investors, buy tokens, and use the product. Tokens raised during the crowdsale will be used for product development, while investors will trade or exchange tokens when the price goes up.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing to decide before investing money is to analyze the IDO project with regard to all aspects: clearly-defined company strategy, team experience, and timeliness of release of technical information (white paper). One of the main elements of launching a crowdsale is developing your IDO cabinet with contribution flow and a widget. Make it user-friendly and convenient for investors to use.<\/p>\n<p>The Applicature team provides our customers with <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/ico-cabinet\/\" rel=\"noopener\">IDO cabinet development<\/a><\/span> with full-cycle technical support.

This option can help engage more investors with the help of robust contribution management.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1349\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Applicature-payment-methods.png\" alt=\"Applicature offers ICO payment methods for investments\" width=\"1132\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Applicature-payment-methods.png 1132w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Applicature-payment-methods-350x108.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Applicature-payment-methods-500x155.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Applicature-payment-methods-768x237.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Applicature-payment-methods-1024x317.png 1024w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Applicature-payment-methods-600x186.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Applicature-payment-methods-132x41.png 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1132px) 100vw, 1132px\" \/><br \/>\nMultiple payment methods allow the payment procedure to increase the token-sale rating. The contribution flow is instantly fulfilled in the cabinet in the following ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the user chooses a currency with which to contribute<\/li>\n<li>Multivest generates the transaction data<\/li>\n<li>The transaction is confirmed, inserting additional data into the wallet<\/li>\n<li>the definite number of tokens is sent to the user wallet<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All transactions are transparent, and visible in the cabinet in the \u201cTransaction History\u201d field. As soon as the transaction has been confirmed, the user can check the transaction in the history. This simplifies the contribution process by eliminating the need to search for transactions using other services.<\/p>\n<h3>Client Communication<\/h3>\n<p>An important and vital part of every IDO campaign is client communication. The Applicature cabinet allows users to be involved in communication with project team members. The messaging center and FAQ section are available as additional services. Facebook, Telegram, Reddit, and other tools can be integrated with the cabinet to keep in touch with your customers throughout the crowdsale.<br \/>\nHere is an example of how the FAQ section is implemented in the cabinet by Applicature:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1350\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screenshot-at-\u0431\u0435\u0440.-29-16-09-09.png\" alt=\"Applicature offers ICO cabinet marketing services\" width=\"1858\" height=\"1072\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screenshot-at-\u0431\u0435\u0440.-29-16-09-09.png 1858w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screenshot-at-\u0431\u0435\u0440.-29-16-09-09-132x76.png 132w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screenshot-at-\u0431\u0435\u0440.-29-16-09-09-350x202.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screenshot-at-\u0431\u0435\u0440.-29-16-09-09-500x288.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screenshot-at-\u0431\u0435\u0440.-29-16-09-09-768x443.png 768w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screenshot-at-\u0431\u0435\u0440.-29-16-09-09-1024x591.png 1024w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screenshot-at-\u0431\u0435\u0440.-29-16-09-09-600x346.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screenshot-at-\u0431\u0435\u0440.-29-16-09-09-120x69.png 120w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screenshot-at-\u0431\u0435\u0440.-29-16-09-09-300x173.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1858px) 100vw, 1858px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Additional Services<\/h3>\n<p>Applicature offers referral programs and bounty management campaigns as rewards systems.
