That\u2019s pretty high in comparison with a software developer\u2019s average salary: $105,000 for\u00a0the same period of time. The question\u00a0arises: is there any\u00a0demand for blockchain developers? There certainly is!<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start our long but entertaining journey by discovering the keystones of innovative blockchain technology, which has disruptive significance in the new era of data processing.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Blockchain?<\/h2>\n<p>The<span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/the-blockchain-ecosystem\"> blockchain<\/a><\/span>\u00a0is a digital database that contains shared, replicated, and synchronized data open to participants in the block. One can store records of transactions, each of which has a timestamp and unique cryptographic signature to make an immutable history of all asset transactions accessible to every member of the ledger. In this way, blockchain also serves as a private electronic ledger. The blockchain (or <em>peer-to-peer network<\/em>) is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>decentralized<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The information in it isn\u2019t stored in a certain place but is spread among a number of computers, which are called nodes.

Here are some other unique blockchain features: As you now know, the blockchain is decentralized. This decentralization provides a transparency and traceability of business processes that makes the system impossible to hack. It is also known for its method of carrying out the transactions: Here is a pyramid that includes a list of must-have experience and skills for a blockchain developer: Now let\u2019s consider what a blockchain developer should know, and what challenges he\/she might face.<\/p>\n<h2>Knowledge<\/h2>\n<p>First of all, anyone who wants to become a blockchain developer must begin by learning the basics of the blockchain system. Demands for developers can be different, but having the fundamentals down seems to be number one. The more you know, the greater your chance of becoming a seasoned developer. There is no need to start buying cryptocurrency, but by all means, familiarizing yourself with the variety of crypto coins and understanding the differences between them will be a needed skill when learning the core fundamental concepts of the blockchain. Let\u2019s explore the main requirements for developers in 2017:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A BS\/MS degree in computer science or engineering<\/li>\n<li>No less than 2 years of experience as a software engineer(Fin-tech representatives are welcomed.)<\/li>\n<li>A deep understanding of ledgers, the blockchain, and cryptocurrency (practical experience is a bonus.)<\/li>\n<li>Web development skills using HTML, CSS, NodeJS, and MongoDB<\/li>\n<li>Be sufficiently skilled in security and decentralized technologies.<\/li>\n<li>Feel comfortable with at least one of the following coding languages: Go, C, C++ , JAVA, Python.<\/li>\n<li>Knowledge of distributed storage, like RDBMS or NoSQL<\/li>\n<li>Skills in blockchain business applications<\/li>\n<li>Blockchain development requires close cooperation with professionals in networking and data security and a working knowledge of algorithms, taking into the account the time and resource complexity of querying a data structure (Stack, Queues, LinkedList, Tree, and Hedera HashMaps).<\/li>\n<li>Other important skills: time planning, team collaboration, and the ability to prioritize tasks.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2029 size-full\" title=\"basic knowledge of blockchain\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/basic-knowledge-of-blockchain.png\" alt=\"basic knowledge of blockchain\" width=\"716\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/basic-knowledge-of-blockchain.png 716w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/basic-knowledge-of-blockchain-350x237.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/basic-knowledge-of-blockchain-500x339.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/basic-knowledge-of-blockchain-600x406.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/basic-knowledge-of-blockchain-132x89.png 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another useful advantage is knowledge of basic architectures like MVC, MVVM, document-view architecture, and microservices, which will help to distinguish differences between conventional and decentralized architecture. Learning the core concepts of communication architecture \u2014 for example, publisher\/subscriber, message broker, and bus architecture \u2014 also will serve as a bonus. Becoming a developer is like a stack, with technologies continually being added to the top. The developer uses last in\/first out.

Famous universities like Princeton, UC Berkeley, and Stanford provide people all around the world with the opportunity to attend online courses in blockchain project development.<\/p>\n<h2>Solidity<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to write smart contracts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, you\u2019ll have to learn the commonly used Solidity programming language. Solidity was developed by Gavin Wood, Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi, Yoichi Hirai, and other Ethereum influencers. Solidity enables code design, keeping in mind the rules of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM.<\/p>\n<p>Solidity was influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript, so if you already know these, it won\u2019t be difficult to master Solidity, as they are very similar. Discover how developers benefit from the Solidity language:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complex member variables like hierarchical mappings and structures are provided.<\/li>\n<li>There is the opportunity of inheritance, including multiple inheritances.<\/li>\n<li>The Application Binary Interface (ABI) was designed for multiple safe functions of a single contract, detecting errors in the case of erroneous data entry.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As blockchain technology is constantly developing, it is highly recommended that you develop your skills by reading related books, watching videos, and taking specialized courses. Here are the top 10 selected courses for blockchain developers, according to expert opinion:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ethereum Blockchain Developer: Build Projects Using Solidity &#8211;\u00a0<span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/courses\/ethereum-blockchain-developer-build-projects-using-solidity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/howtotoken.com<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Certified Ethereum Developer Course, B9Lab &#8211;\u00a0<span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/courses\/certified-online-ethereum-developer-b9lab-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/howtotoken.com<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies, Princeton University, Coursera &#8211;\u00a0<span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/courses\/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-technologies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/howtotoken.com<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li>IBM Developer Works, Blockchain Essentials (coding skills required) &#8211; <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/courses\/ibm-developer-works-blockchain-essentials-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/howtotoken.com<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li>IBM Developer Works, IBM Blockchain foundation developer (Coding skills required) &#8211; <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/courses\/ibm-developer-works-ibm-blockchain-foundation-developer-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/howtotoken.com<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Cryptozombies \u2013 Learn to Code By Building Your Own Game (\u0441oding skills required) &#8211; <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/courses\/cryptozombies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/howtotoken.com<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li>An Introduction to HyperLedger Technologies by Linux Foundation (Coding skills required) &#8211; <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/courses\/blockchain-business-introduction-hyperledger-technologies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/howtotoken.com<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Blockgeeks \u2013 blockchain course library (coding skills required) &#8211; <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/courses\/blockgeeks-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/howtotoken.com<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Become a Blockchain Developer with Ethereum and Solidity (coding skills required) &#8211; <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/courses\/become-blockchain-developer-ethereum-solidity-udemy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/howtotoken.com<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer\u2019s Guide (coding skills required) &#8211; <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/courses\/ethereum-solidity-complete-developers-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/howtotoken.com<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Code Features<\/h2>\n<p>The coding on blockchain does not present complications, as this distributed ledger is self-executing. Knowing the JavaScript language is quite enough for the creation of a layer. The main thing one should remember is that everything that runs on blockchain is visible to everyone, so it can be hacked, and the owner of a block or blocks could lose millions of dollars. This is why code development takes plenty of time \u2014 to exclude possible vulnerabilities, and, as a result, decrease the possibility of hack attacks. Another detail worth remembering is that multiple transactions can\u2019t be implemented at the same time. This helps to reduce the number of mistakes during transactions; to avoid double spends, for example. One of the unique features of blockchain is deterministic behavior. This means that all transaction operations are behaving in one way. For example, if today, A + B = C, then tomorrow, the program will give the same output for a given input, regardless of circumstances. Consider possible cases in which a program can behave in a non-deterministic manner:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>by the request of a programmer &#8211; when there is a need for non-deterministic system functions.<\/li>\n<li>when the data source contains non-deterministic data, the program acts in non-deterministic nature.<\/li>\n<li>during the dynamic call &#8211; when one program calls another, and this call is determined only during its execution.<\/li>\n<li>smart-contracts and transaction isolation is a solution that allows protection from non-desirable results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In order to write a Java Chain code, you need only 3 elements:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gradle<\/li>\n<li>JDK<\/li>\n<li>Vagrant<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Smart-Contract Education<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1975 size-full\" title=\"blockchain developer skills\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/applicatore\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/nick_szabo_smart_contract.png\" alt=\"Smart contract\" width=\"668\" height=\"121\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/nick_szabo_smart_contract.png 668w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/nick_szabo_smart_contract-350x63.png 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/nick_szabo_smart_contract-500x91.png 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/nick_szabo_smart_contract-600x109.png 600w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/nick_szabo_smart_contract-132x24.png 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A <span style=\"color: #e70f00;\"><a style=\"color: #e70f00;\" href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/smart-contracts-development\/\">smart contract<\/a><\/span> as a digital, decentralized application written in code to ensure the credibility of an agreement.
