Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is represented by a string of code that is non-changing in nature and carries a value known as a \u201ctoken\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each set of code makes up a \u201cblock\u201d of information, and a transaction takes place when funds are transferred and they are recorded in a public ledger known as the Blockchain. The\u00a0Blockchain\u00a0contains blocks of information linked in a chainlike manner and each new transaction represented by a new block of code is added to this chain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This blockchain ledger is updated across each of the participating nodes and these nodes retain a similar copy of the whole chain on every node. This makes it transparent and impossible to be manipulated or modified by a single entity. It is highly secure due to its security architecture and it is safer than the traditional banking system for peer-to-peer transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Cryptocurrency Exchange<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through a crypto exchange platform, there are many ways users can get specific cryptocurrencies. The platform allows users to create a unique cryptocurrency wallet and accept cryptocurrencies from others in exchange for services or products. A\u00a0crypto exchange business, make it possible for users to purchase cryptocurrencies by buying them directly using regular fiat money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How does this work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cryptocurrency exchange platform serves as an open market that allows buying, selling, or trading of cryptocurrency tokens and fiat money by users. Hence, a cryptocurrency exchange platform is software that allows various users to collaborate and trade using fiat currencies and cryptocurrency tokens with blockchain technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The terms cryptocurrency market and cryptocurrency exchange are closely related with little difference. The cryptocurrency market allows users to PURCHASE cryptocurrency tokens using FIAT currencies while a crypto exchange enables users to TRADE services, products, and digital goods in exchange for fiat currencies or cryptocurrency tokens. It is similar to the stock exchange where users make currency exchange and trading activity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Types of Exchanges<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two notable types of cryptocurrency exchange software a crypto trading agency can build.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional exchange<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peer-to-peer exchange<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The traditional exchange<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This exchange allows owners to set a predetermined set of rules and users that visit the webpage can post listings or offers that comply with the pre-set terms and conditions. Buyers who are interested will be able to secure a deal without having to deal directly with the sellers because each of the transactions takes place via an order book that serves as the intermediary on the platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Peer-to-Peer exchange<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The P2P exchange allows merchants and sellers to create listings, contracts and offers based on their personal terms and conditions. The merchant or traders and the buyer can also communicate with themselves by using a direct message option on the crypto exchange platform. Every transaction takes place directly between the merchant\/seller and the buyer and the goods are stored in a \u201cvault\u201d in the form of a smart contract until both of them fulfill their part of the deal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The type of cryptocurrency exchange to use often depends on your preferences and it is best to consult with our specialists, experts, and developers on what platform will suit your business before making the final decision.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At applicature, we have already implemented successful <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-events-and-news\/ethereum-proof-of-stake-implementation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cryptocurrency exchange<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> platforms across different platforms.
