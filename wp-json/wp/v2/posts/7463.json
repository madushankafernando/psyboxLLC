Developing an NFT marketplace helps you to tokenize your collectable items.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s where you can rely on our expert blockchain developers at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applicature<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

We offer you a secure NFT marketplace development platform to build a multi-million revenue system as an early NFT adopter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NFT marketplace acts as a lucrative income system for artists, musicians, and other unique creators; its importance in art and games creates multiple services to integrate AR\/VR. The digitization of real estate in NFT takes the ecosystem of real estate and design into virtual settings. NFTs&#8217; significance in the marketplace is still under research and development, and there is a massive potential for innovation and investment opportunities in this marketplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Record-breaking Month for NFTs<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 2021 stands out in significance for NFTs and could as well set the pace for what&#8217;s to come on the NFT marketplace. Here are some significant purchases made during this month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 11, first-ever NFT artwork sold at Christie&#8217;s auction for a staggering $69 million, putting artist Beeple among the top league of the most expensive living artists.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sold the first-ever tweet published on March 21, 2006, as an NFT for $2.9 million. The tweet reads: &#8220;just setting up my twttr,&#8221;.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gucci recently launched a digital-only footwear selling at hundreds of dollars below what their physical shoes usually sell.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now to the most significant and recent sale, Mars House, the world&#8217;s first-ever digital NFT (non-fungible token) home, sold for more than $500,000 US, bringing a potential digital real estate market into the spotlight.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hand-painted &#8220;self-portrait&#8221; by the world-famous humanoid robot, Sophia, has been sold at auction for over $688,000.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NFTs will keep making headlines for the online sale of artworks. This unique digital token efficiently verifies authenticity and ownership with the artist&#8217;s signature or trademark encrypted on the blockchain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>NFT marketplace platform development<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NFT marketplace platform development has generated millions of dollars for early adopters like OpenSea and Rarible. This potential marketplace has just 27 unique digital art platforms on Ethereum, with MakersPlace, Async Art SuperRare, and Known Origin facilitating between $1-$8 million in sales. This volume of sales is little for the vast potential it has to service many industries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Features of the NFT Marketplace Platform<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Trading<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NFT platform allows the trading of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERC-721 non-fungible tokens<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple marketplaces. It will enable token holders to access numerous services like complex trading systems, bidding platforms, bundling opportunities, and opportunities to sell in a thriving market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Standardization<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standardization gives you access to the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best non-fungible tokens<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the blockchain. Developers build, deploy and fix various bugs and errors on these blockchain platforms. They also help to standardize ownership, transfer, and control of tokenized assets in NFT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Liquidity<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The liquidity pool offers the opportunity to convert crypto to quick cash and vice versa. The instant tradability of NFT assets makes them accessible to many traders or investors on the platform. This ability gives them the potential to expand unique digital assets and collectibles market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Interoperability<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NFT standard ERC-721 and ERC-1155 Tokens interact with multiple ecosystems. This feature allows the new projects of NFT to be available in numerous markets and accessible from different wallets in the marketplace. The open-source code is clear, consistent, reliable, and secure with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/blog\/blockchain-technology\/blockchain-api\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">API access<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> permission for the reading and writing data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Scarcity<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NFTs can be programmed to create only a specified number of specific assets or rare items. This method makes it possible to place a large amount of capital on a separate <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">list of non-fungible tokens<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and implement an unmodifiable property using a smart contract. This improves the uniqueness of created assets on the blockchain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Control<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though NFTs are fully programmable, many have more complex design structures like random generation, forging, crafting, redeeming, and lots more. The design space offers a wide range of possibilities that allows for retaining control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>How to create, sell and buy NFT tokens<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though there exist thousands of NFTs via various marketplaces, not all marketplaces can support the same NFTs due to different token standards. Ethereum leads the way among other blockchain platforms to create a standard, the ERC-721. ERC-1155 token standard was developed after the former one, and it allows bounding together multiple NFTs in a single transaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A use case example of this feature is seen in swapping many armor pieces from one character to another within a mobile game. Also, the BEP-721 was released by Binance in late 2020, and it was followed by the BEP-1155 standard released in early 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Image 2<\/b><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7466\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7466\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/enjin.io\/blog\/why-nfts-have-real-value\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-7466\" src=\"http:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/NFT-Marketplace-on-Blockchain-can-be-a-Promising-investment-choice-1-500x331.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" srcset=\"https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/NFT-Marketplace-on-Blockchain-can-be-a-Promising-investment-choice-1-500x331.jpg 500w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/NFT-Marketplace-on-Blockchain-can-be-a-Promising-investment-choice-1-350x232.jpg 350w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/NFT-Marketplace-on-Blockchain-can-be-a-Promising-investment-choice-1-132x87.jpg 132w, https:\/\/applicature.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/NFT-Marketplace-on-Blockchain-can-be-a-Promising-investment-choice-1.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7466\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Collectibles.

Whether it is a GIF or an image, NFT artworks are effortless to make. Everyone can also create collectibles like sets of digital cards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you begin, you have to decide on the blockchain platform you want to issue your NFTs. As of today, Ethereum is the leading blockchain service for issuing NFTs. However, some other blockchain platforms are becoming more popular as NFT platforms. They include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Binance Smart Chain\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flow by Dapper Labs\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polkadot<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tezos<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmos<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tron<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EOS<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WAX<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every blockchain platform has its own separate NFT token standard, a wallet service, and marketplace. If you create NFTs on a blockchain, you can only sell them on platforms that support that blockchain. For example, NFTs from the Binance Smart Chain will only be sold on platforms that support Binance Smart Chain assets. The implication is that you wouldn&#8217;t sell them on something like VIV3 \u2013 a Flow blockchain-based marketplace \u2013 or OpenSea, an Ethereum-based NFT marketplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum blockchain has the largest NFT ecosystem. Hence, to mint your own NFT artwork, video, or music, you will need:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An Ethereum wallet. The wallet should support Ethereum-based NFT token standard ERC-721, such as MetaMask, Coinbase, or Trust Wallet.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get about $50-$100 in ETH on your wallet. You can do this by buying crypto or changing fiat currency into crypto if your wallet supports this action.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once these requirements are met, most of the NFT-centric platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, and Mintable will allow you to link your wallet and upload your chosen image or file that you want to turn into an NFT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why you should invest in NFTs<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the positive headlines made by NFTs, it is proving to become a profitable investment largely due to some of the following reasons.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Creation of valuable tokenized assets<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a medium for tokenizing physical objects like artwork eliminates its duplication and restricts its ownership to the owner. This leads to a scarcity of rare pieces of art and an increase in their value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Liquidity for Investors<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to have an asset that you can easily convert to cash whenever you need it, this might be a suitable alternative for you. Tokenized assets like Non-fungible tokens are easy to convert to fiat currency. For example, owning a virtual land can allow you to rent out the land or virtual space to advertisers at a price while still retaining the ownership. Owners can also sell off a portion of the virtual land to get cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Growth Potential<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NFTs have the potential to appreciate in value over time. For example, ownership and control of virtual real estate allow deciding how you want to use your land, like renting it out or building a secure business for online sale adverts. Artworks also increase in value over time due to their uniqueness and scarcity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Popular NFT Marketplaces<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The increasing popularity of NFTs comes with a diverse number of new NFTs marketplace. It&#8217;s best to do your personal research before choosing a platform to avoid false or scam sites. Here are some popular NFTs marketplace<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>1- Rarible<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rarible has witnessed significant success in recent months. This platform that started in 2020 was designed to be the first global NFT marketplace with the ERC-20 RARI token. RARI token holders participate in the governance and retain voting and management rights. It is the first token used for governance in the NFT platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rarible also introduced the concept of \u201cMarketplace liquidity mining\u201d. In addition to being able to purchase no fungible tokens, the RARI token serves as a means of compensation for active users who buy or sell on the marketplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is easy to create an account and set it up.
